1.1.Ti=Payments to Holders of Preferred Stock

1.1.sec=In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation or any Deemed Liquidation Event (as defined below), before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock by reason of their ownership thereof, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding must be paid out of the funds and assets available for distribution to its stockholders, an amount per share equal to the greater of (a) the Original Issue Price for such share of Preferred Stock, plus any dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (b)  such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock pursuant to Section 3 immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event.  If upon any such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event of the Corporation, the funds and assets available for distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation are insufficient to pay the holders of shares of Preferred Stock the full amount to which they are entitled under this Section 1.1, the holders of shares of Preferred Stock will share ratably in any distribution of the funds and assets available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts that would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares of Preferred Stock held by them upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.  

1.2.Ti=Payments to Holders of Common Stock

1.2.sec=In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event of the Corporation, after the payment of all preferential amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock as provided in Section 1.1, the remaining funds and assets available for distribution to the stockholders of the Corporation will be distributed among the holders of shares of Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares of Common Stock held by each such holder.

1.3.1.1.sec=a merger or consolidation in which (i) the Corporation is a constituent party or (ii) a subsidiary of the Corporation is a constituent party and the Corporation issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such merger or consolidation, except any such merger or consolidation involving the Corporation or a subsidiary in which the shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation continue to represent, or are converted into or exchanged for equity securities that represent, immediately following such merger or consolidation, at least a majority, by voting power, of the equity securities of (1) the surviving or resulting party or (2) if the surviving or resulting party is a wholly owned subsidiary of another party immediately following such merger or consolidation, the parent of such surviving or resulting party; provided that, for the purpose of this Section 1.3.1, all shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of options outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation or upon conversion of Convertible Securities (as defined below) outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall be deemed to be outstanding immediately prior to such merger or consolidation and, if applicable, deemed to be converted or exchanged in such merger or consolidation on the same terms as the actual outstanding shares of Common Stock are converted or exchanged; or

1.3.1.2.sec=the sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, by the Corporation or any subsidiary of the Corporation of all or substantially all the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, or, if substantially all of the assets of the Corporation and its subsidiaries taken as a whole are held by such subsidiary or subsidiaries, the sale or disposition (whether by merger or otherwise) of one or more subsidiaries of the Corporation, except where such sale, lease, transfer or other disposition is to the Corporation or one or more wholly owned subsidiaries of the Corporation.

2.Ti=Voting

2.1.Ti=General

2.1.sec=On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation (or by written consent of stockholders in lieu of meeting), each holder of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock may cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter.  Fractional votes shall not be permitted and any fractional voting rights available on an as-converted basis (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred stock held by each holder could be converted) will be rounded to the nearest whole number (with one-half being rounded upward).  Except as provided by law or by the other provisions of this Restated Certificate, holders of Preferred Stock shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class on an as-converted basis, shall have full voting rights and powers equal to the voting rights and powers of the holders of Common Stock, and shall be entitled, notwithstanding any provision of this Restated Certificate, to notice of any stockholder meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.

3.Ti=Conversion

3.0.sec=The holders of the Preferred Stock have the following conversion rights (the “Conversion Rights”):


3.1.Ti=Right to Convert

3.1.1.Ti=Conversion Ratio

3.1.1.sec=Each share of Preferred Stock is convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock as is determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the series of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price for that series of Preferred Stock in effect at the time of conversion.  The “Conversion Price” for each series of Preferred Stock means the Original Issue Price for such series of Preferred Stock, which initial Conversion Price, and the rate at which shares of Preferred Stock may be converted into shares of Common Stock, is subject to adjustment as provided in this Restated Certificate.

3.1.2.Ti=Termination of Conversion Rights

3.1.2.sec=Subject to Section 3.3.1 in the case of a Contingency Event herein, in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation or a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Conversion Rights will terminate at the close of business on the last full day preceding the date fixed for the first payment of any funds and assets distributable on such event to the holders of Preferred Stock.

3.1.=[Bit/Sec_02]

3.2.Ti=Fractional Shares

3.2.sec=No fractional shares of Common Stock will be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Stock.  In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined in good faith by the Board.  Whether or not fractional shares would be issuable upon such conversion will be determined on the basis of the total number of shares of Preferred Stock the holder is at the time converting into Common Stock and the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

3.3.Ti=Mechanics of Conversion

3.3.1.Ti=Notice of Conversion

3.3.1.sec=To voluntarily convert shares of Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock, a holder of Preferred Stock shall surrender the certificate or certificates for the shares of Preferred Stock (or, if such registered holder alleges that any such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate), at the office of the transfer agent for the Preferred Stock (or at the principal office of the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent), together with written notice that the holder elects to convert all or any number of the shares of the Preferred Stock represented by the certificate or certificates and, if applicable, any event on which the conversion is contingent (a “Contingency Event”).  The conversion notice must state the holder’s name or the names of the nominees in which such holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock to be issued.  If required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.  The close of business on the date of receipt by the transfer agent (or by the Corporation if the Corporation serves as its own transfer agent) of the certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) and notice (or, if later, the date on which all Contingency Events have occurred) will be the time of conversion (the “Conversion Time”), and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the shares represented by such certificate shall be deemed to be outstanding of record as of such time.  The Corporation shall, as soon as practicable after the Conversion Time, (a) issue and deliver to the holder, or to the holder’s nominees, a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion in accordance with the provisions of this Restated Certificate and a certificate for the number (if any) of the shares of Preferred Stock represented by the surrendered certificate that were not converted into Common Stock, (b) pay in cash such amount as provided in Section 3.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and (c) pay all declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.

3.3.2.Ti=Reservation of Shares

3.3.2.sec=For the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall at all times while any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding, reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued capital stock, , that number of its duly authorized shares of Common Stock as may from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock is not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause such corporate action to be taken as may be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to this Restated Certificate.  Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock below the then-par value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall take any corporate action that may be necessary so that the Corporation may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at such adjusted Conversion Price.

3.3.3.Ti=Effect of Conversion

3.3.3.sec=All shares of Preferred Stock that shall have been surrendered for conversion as provided in this Restated Certificate shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding and all rights with respect to such shares will immediately cease and terminate at the Conversion Time, except only the right of the holders thereof to receive shares of Common Stock in exchange therefor, to receive payment in lieu of any fraction of a share otherwise issuable upon such conversion as provided in Section 3.2, and to receive payment of any dividends declared but unpaid thereon.  Any shares of Preferred Stock so converted shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued.

3.3.4.Ti=No Further Adjustment

3.3.4.sec=Upon any conversion of shares of Preferred Stock, no adjustment to the Conversion Price of the applicable series of Preferred Stock will be made with respect to the converted shares for any declared but unpaid dividends on such series of Preferred Stock or on the Common Stock delivered upon conversion.

3.3.=[Bit/Sec_04]

3.4.Ti=Adjustment for Stock Splits and Combinations

3.4.sec=If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the date on which the first share of a series of Preferred Stock is issued by the Corporation (such date referred to herein as the “Original Issue Date” for such series of Preferred Stock) effects a subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before that subdivision shall be proportionately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of that series will be increased in proportion to the increase in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock combines the outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price for each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the combination will be proportionately increased so that the number of shares of Common Stock issuable on conversion of each share of such series shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.  Any adjustment under this Section 3.4 becomes effective at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

3.5.Ti=Adjustment for Certain Dividends and Distributions

3.5.0.sec=If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable on the Common Stock in additional shares of Common Stock, then and in each such event the Conversion Price for such series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately before the event will be decreased as of the time of such issuance or, in the event a a record date has been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying such Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction:

3.5.1.sec=the numerator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time of the issuance or the close of business on the record date, and

3.5.2.sec=the denominator of which is the total number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately before the time of such issuance or the close of business on the record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable in payment of such dividend or distribution.

3.5.90.sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if such record date has have been fixed and the dividend is not fully paid or if such distribution is not fully made on the date fixed therefor, such Conversion Price shall be recomputed accordingly as of the close of business on such record date and thereafter such Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to this Section 3.5 as of the time of actual payment of such dividends or distributions; and (ii) no such adjustment shall be made if the holders of such series of Preferred Stock simultaneously receive a dividend or other distribution of shares of Common Stock in a number equal to the number of shares of Common Stock that they would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of the event.

3.5.=[Bit/Ssec_02]

3.6.Ti=Adjustments for Other Dividends and Distributions

3.6.sec=If the Corporation at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock shall makes or issues, or fixes a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive, a dividend or other distribution payable in securities of the Corporation (other than a distribution of shares of Common Stock in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), then and in each such event the Corporation shall make, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend or other distribution to the holders of the series of Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the amount of securities as the holders would have received if all outstanding shares of such series of Preferred Stock had been converted into Common Stock on the date of such event.
3.7.Ti=Adjustment for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution

3.7.sec=If at any time or from time to time after the Original Issue Date for a series of Preferred Stock the Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock is changed into the same or a different number of shares of any class or classes of stock of the Corporation, whether by recapitalization, reclassification, or otherwise (other than by a stock split or combination, dividend, distribution, merger or consolidation covered by Sections 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 or 3.8 or by Section 1.3 regarding a Deemed Liquidation Event), then in any such event each holder of such series of Preferred Stock may thereafter convert such stock into the kind and amount of stock and other securities and property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification or other change by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into which such shares of Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification or change. 

3.8.Ti=Adjustment for Merger or Consolidation

3.8.sec=Subject to the provisions of Section 1.3, if any consolidation or merger occurs involving the Corporation in which the Common Stock (but not a series of Preferred Stock) is converted into or exchanged for securities, cash, or other property (other than a transaction covered by Sections 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7), then, following any such consolidation or merger, the Corporation shall provide that each share of such series of Preferred Stock will thereafter be convertible, in lieu of the Common Stock into which it was convertible prior to the event, into the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other property which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Corporation issuable upon conversion of one share of such series of Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consolidation or merger would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the transaction; and, in such case, the Corporation shall make appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith by the Board) in the application of the provisions in this Section 3 with respect to the rights and interests thereafter of the holders of such series of Preferred Stock, to the end that the provisions set forth in this Section 3 (including provisions with respect to changes in and other adjustments of the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any securities or other property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

3.9.Ti=Certificate as to Adjustments

3.9.sec=Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price of a series of Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable but in any event not later than 15 days thereafter, compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of this Restated Certificate and furnish to each holder of such series of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth the adjustment or readjustment (including the kind and amount of securities, cash, or other property into which such series of Preferred Stock is convertible) and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.  The Corporation shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the written request at any time of any holder of any series of Preferred Stock (but in any event not later than 10 days thereafter), furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a certificate setting forth (a) the Conversion Price of such series of Preferred Stock then in effect and (b) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities, cash, or property which then would be received upon the conversion of such series of Preferred Stock.

3.10.Ti=Mandatory Conversion

3.10.sec=Upon either (a) the closing of the sale of shares of Common Stock to the public in a firm-commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or (b) the date and time, or the occurrence of an event, specified by vote or written consent of the Requisite Holders at the time of such vote or consent, voting as a single class on an as-converted basis (the time of such closing or the date and time specified or the time of the event specified in such vote or written consent,the “Mandatory Conversion Time”), (i) all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock will automatically convert into shares of Common Stock, at the applicable ratio described in Section 3.1.1 as the same may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with Section 3 and (ii) such shares may not be reissued by the Corporation.

3.11.Ti=Procedural Requirements

3.11.sec=The Corporation shall notify in writing all holders of record of shares of Preferred Stock of the Mandatory Conversion Time and the place designated for mandatory conversion of all such shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to Section 3.10.  Unless otherwise provided in this Restated Certificate, the notice need not be sent in advance of the occurrence of the Mandatory Conversion Time.  Upon receipt of the notice, each holder of shares of Preferred Stock shall surrender such holder’s certificate or certificates for all such shares (or, if such holder alleges that such certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a lost certificate affidavit and agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of such certificate) to the Corporation at the place designated in such notice, and shall thereafter receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Section 3.  If so required by the Corporation, certificates surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the registered holder or such holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing.  All rights with respect to the Preferred Stock converted pursuant to Section 3.10, including the rights, if any, to receive notices and vote (other than as a holder of Common Stock), will terminate at the Mandatory Conversion Time (notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof to surrender the certificates at or prior to such time), except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) therefor, to receive the items provided for in the next sentence of this Section 3.11.  As soon as practicable after the Mandatory Conversion Time and the surrender of the certificate or certificates (or lost certificate affidavit and agreement) for Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall issue and deliver to such holder, or to such holder’s nominee(s), a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of Common Stock issuable on such conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof, together with cash as provided in Section 3.2 in lieu of any fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon such conversion and the payment of any declared but unpaid dividends on the shares of Preferred Stock converted.  Such converted Preferred Stock shall be retired and cancelled and may not be reissued as shares of such series, and the Corporation may thereafter take such appropriate action (without the need for stockholder action) as may be necessary to reduce the authorized number of shares of Preferred Stock (and the applicable series thereof) accordingly.  

3.=[Bit/Sec_11]

4.Ti=Dividends

4.sec=The Corporation shall declare all dividends pro rata on the Common Stock and the Preferred Stock on a pari passu basis according to the number of shares of Common Stock held by such holders.

5.Ti=Redeemed or Otherwise Acquired Shares

5.sec=Any shares of Preferred Stock that are redeemed or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries will be automatically and immediately cancelled and retired and shall not be reissued, sold or transferred.
