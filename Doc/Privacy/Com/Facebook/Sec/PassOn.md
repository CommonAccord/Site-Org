Ti=Other websites and applications

0.sec=Learn about things like social plugins and how information is shared with the games, applications and websites you and your friends use off Facebook.

1.Ti=About Facebook Platform

1.sec=Facebook Platform (or simply Platform) refers to the way we help you share your information with the games, applications, and websites you and your friends use. Facebook Platform also lets you bring your friends with you, so you can connect with them off Facebook. In these two ways, Facebook Platform helps you make your experiences on the web more personalized and social. <img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yF/r/-y15DBEE2aI.png" width="126" height="126" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Remember that these games, applications and websites are created and maintained by other businesses and developers who are not part of, or controlled by, Facebook, so you should always make sure to read their terms of service and privacy policies to understand how they treat your data. </div>

2.Ti=Controlling what information you share with applications

2.sec=When you connect with a game, application or website - such as by going to a game, logging in to a website using your Facebook account, or adding an app to your timeline - we give the game, application, or website (sometimes referred to as just "applications" or "apps") your basic info (we sometimes call this your "public profile"), which includes your User ID and your public information. We also give them your friends' User IDs (also called your friend list) as part of your basic info. <div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Your friend list helps the application make your experience more social because it lets you find your friends on that application. Your User ID helps the application personalize your experience because it can connect your account on that application with your Facebook account, and it can access your basic info, which includes your <a href="/about/privacy/your-info#public-info"> public information </a> and friend list. This includes the information you choose to make public, as well as information that is always publicly available. If the application needs additional information, such as your stories, photos or likes, it will have to ask you for specific permission. </div><img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yF/r/4Bq4juONVVv.png" width="558" height="377" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> The <a href="/settings/?tab=applications">Apps</a> setting lets you control the applications you use. You can see the permissions you have given these applications, the last time an application accessed your information, and the audience on Facebook for timeline stories and activity the application posts on your behalf. You can also remove applications you no longer want, or turn off all Platform applications. When you turn all Platform applications off, your User ID is no longer given to applications, even when your friends use those applications. But you will no longer be able to use any games, applications or websites through Facebook. </div><img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/JTbjbMiUkJi.png" width="676" height="220" alt="" /><div class="mbl pal uiBoxGray"><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> When you first visit an app, Facebook lets the app know your language, your country, and whether you are in an age group, for instance, under 18, between 18-20, or 21 and over. Age range lets apps provide you with age-appropriate content. If you install the app, it can access, store and update the information you've shared. Apps you've installed can update their records of your basic info, age range, language and country. If you haven't used an app in a while, you should consider removing it. Once you remove an app, it won't be able to continue to update the additional information you've given them permission to access, but it may still hold the information you have already shared. You always can contact the app directly and request that they delete your data. <a href="/help/how-apps-work">Learn more</a>. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Sometimes a game console, mobile phone, or other device might ask for permission to share specific information with the games and applications you use on that device. If you say okay, those applications will not be able to access any other information about you without asking specific permission from you or your friends. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Sites and apps that use Instant Personalization receive your User ID and friend list when you visit them. <a href="#instantpersonal">Learn more</a>. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> You always can remove apps you've installed by using your <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications"> app settings</a>. But remember, apps may still be able to access your information when the people you share with use them. And, if you've removed an application and want it to delete the information you've already shared with it, you should contact the application. Visit the application's page on Facebook or its own website to learn more about the app. For example, Apps may have reasons (e.g. legal obligations) to retain some data that you share with them. </div>

3.Ti=Controlling what is shared when the people you share with use applications

3.sec=Just like when you share information by email or elsewhere on the web, information you share on Facebook can be re-shared. This means that if you share something on Facebook, anyone who can see it can share it with others, including the games, applications, and websites they use. <div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Your friends and the other people you share information with often want to share your information with applications to make their experiences on those applications more personalized and social. For example, one of your friends might want to use a music application that allows them to see what their friends are listening to. To get the full benefit of that application, your friend would want to give the application her friend list - which includes your User ID - so the application knows which of her friends is also using it. Your friend might also want to share the music you "like" on Facebook. If you have made that information public, then the application can access it just like anyone else. But if you've shared your likes with just your friends, the application could ask your friend for permission to share them. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> You can control most of the information other people can share with applications they use from the "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications"> Apps</a>" settings page. But these controls do not let you limit access to your <a href="/about/privacy/your-info#public-info"> public information </a> and friend list. </div><img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y4/r/yjwcsS19cKD.png" width="579" height="398" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you want to completely block applications from getting your information when your friends and others use them, you will need to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=privacy"> turn off all Platform applications </a>. This means that you will no longer be able to use any third-party Facebook-integrated games, applications or websites. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If an application asks permission from someone else to access your information, the application will be allowed to use that information only in connection with the person that gave the permission, and no one else. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> For example, some apps use information such as your friends list, to personalize your experience or show you which of your friends use that particular app. </div>

4.Ti=Logging in to another site using Facebook

4.sec=Facebook Platform lets you log into other applications and websites using your Facebook account. When you log in using Facebook, we give the site your User ID (just like when you connect with any other application), but we do not share your email address or password with that website through this process without your permission. <img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y1/r/TbuMxKtIY9Z.png" width="535" height="204" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you already have an account on that website, the site may also be able to connect that account with your Facebook account. Sometimes it does this using what is called an "email hash", which is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address. Only the email addresses in this case are hashed so no email addresses are actually shared between Facebook and the website. </div><div class="mbs _6p _6v"> How it works </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> The website sends over a hashed version of your email address, and we match it with a database of email addresses that we have also hashed. If there is a match, then we tell the website the User ID associated with the email address. This way, when you log into the website using Facebook, the website can link your Facebook account to your account on that website. </div>

5.Ti=About social plugins

5.sec=Social plugins are buttons, boxes, and stories (such as the Like button) that other websites can use to present Facebook content to you and create more social and personal experiences for you. While you view these buttons, boxes, and stories on other sites, the content comes directly from Facebook. <img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yZ/r/PDpTSPFpQwm.png" width="373" height="163" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Sometimes plugins act just like applications. You can spot one of these plugins because it will ask you for permission to access your information or to publish information back to Facebook. For example, if you use a registration plugin on a website, the plugin will ask your permission to share your basic info with the website to make it easier for you to register for the website. Similarly, if you use an "Add To Timeline" plugin, the plugin will ask for your permission to publish stories about your activities on that website to Facebook. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you make something public using a plugin, such as posting a public comment on a newspaper's website, then that website can access your comment (along with your User ID) just like everyone else. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you post something using a social plugin and you do not see a sharing icon, you should assume that story is Public. For example, if you post a comment through a Facebook comment plugin on a site, your story is Public and everyone, including the website, can see your story. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Websites that use social plugins can sometimes tell that you have engaged with the social plugin. For example, they may know that you clicked on a Like button in a social plugin. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> We receive data when you visit a site with a social plugin. We keep this data for a maximum of 90 days. After that, we remove your name and any other personally identifying information from the data, or combine it with other people's data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. <a href="/help/social-plugins">Learn more</a>. </div>

6.Ti=About instant personalization

6.sec=Instant personalization (sometimes also referred to as "Start now") is a way for Facebook to help partners (such as Bing and Rotten Tomatoes) on and off Facebook to create a more personalized and social experience for logged in users than a <a href="#social-plugins">social plugin</a> can offer. When you visit a site or app using instant personalization, it will know some information about you and your friends the moment you arrive. This is because sites and apps using instant personalization can access your User ID, your friend list, and your <a href="/about/privacy/your-info#public-info"> public information</a>.  <div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> The first time you visit a site or app using instant personalization, you will see a notification letting you know that the site or app has partnered with Facebook to provide a personalized experience. <img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/y5/r/PPaeWQy1T5n.png" width="502" height="77" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> The notification will give you the ability to disable or turn off instant personalization for that site or app. If you do that, that site or app is required to delete all of the information about you it received from Facebook as part of the instant personalization program. In addition, we will prevent that site from accessing your information in the future, even when your friends use that site. <div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you decide that you do not want to experience instant personalization for all partner sites and apps, you can disable instant personalization from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications">"Apps" settings page</a>. </div><img class="mbl privacy_policy_center_img img" src="https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yi/r/XQWgO-QYS8H.png" width="809" height="630" alt="" /><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you turn off instant personalization, these partner third party sites and apps will not be able to access your public information, even when your friends visit those sites. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you turn off an instant personalization site or app after you have been using it or visited it a few times (or after you have given it specific permission to access your data), it will not automatically delete information about you it received through Facebook. Like all other apps, the site is required by our policies to delete information about you if you ask it to do so. </div><div class="mbs _6p _6v"> How it works </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> To join the instant personalization program, a potential partner must enter into an agreement with us designed to protect your privacy. For example, this agreement requires that the partner delete information about you if you turn off instant personalization when you first visit the site or app. It also prevents the partner from accessing any information about you until you or your friends visit its site. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> Instant personalization partners sometimes use an email hash process to see if any of their users are on Facebook and get those users' User IDs. This process is similar to searching for someone on Facebook using an email address, except in this case the email addresses are hashed so no actual email addresses are exchanged. The partner is also contractually required not to use your User ID for any purpose (other than associating it with your account) until you or your friends visit the site. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> When you visit a site or app using instant personalization, we provide the site or app with your User ID and your friend list (as well as your age range, locale, and gender). The site or app can then connect your account with your friends' accounts to make the site or app instantly social. The site can also access public information associated with any of the User IDs it receives, which it can use to make them instantly personalized. For example, if the site is a music site, it can access your music interests to suggest songs you may like, and access your friends' music interests to let you know what they are listening to. Of course it can only access your or your friends' music interests if they are public. If the site or app wants any additional information, it will have to get your specific permission. </div>

7.Ti=Public search engines

7.sec=Your public search setting controls whether people who enter your name on a public search engine may see your public timeline (including in sponsored results). You can find your public search setting on the "<a href="/settings?tab=privacy">Privacy Settings and Tools</a>" settings page. <div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> This setting does not apply to search engines that access your information as an application using Facebook Platform. </div><div class="mbl _6q _6t _mf"> If you turn your public search setting off and then search for yourself on a public search engine, you may still see a preview of your timeline. This is because some search engines cache information for a period of time. You can learn more about how to <a href="/help/?faq=13323">request</a> a search engine to remove you from cached information. </div>
