1.Ti=Information we collect

1.1.sec=We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/ads-youll-find-most-useful.html" id="ads-youll-find-most-useful">ads you'll find most useful</a> or <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/the-people-who-matter-most.html" id="the-people-who-matter-most">the people who matter most to you online</a>.

1.2.0.sec=We collect information in two ways:

1.2.1.sec=<b>Information you give us.</b><br>For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Google Account.

If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=112783">Google Profile</a>, which may include your name and photo.

We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.

1.2.2.4.Ti=Unique application numbers

1.2.2.4.sec=Certain services include a unique application number.

We also use this information to offer you tailored content - like giving you more relevant search results and ads.

2.2.sec=We may use the name you provide for your Google Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Google Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Google Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services.

2.5.sec=We may <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/combine-personal-information.html" id="combine-personal-information">combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services</a> - for example <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/to-make-it-easier-to-share.html" id="to-make-it-easier-to-share">to make it easier to share things with people you know</a>. We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent.

2.=[Z/Sec/s7]

3.Ti=Transparency and choice

3.1.0.sec=People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:

3.1.1.sec=<a href="https://www.google.com/dashboard/?hl=en">Review and control</a> certain types of information tied to your Google Account by using Google Dashboard.

3.1.2.sec=<a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/preferences?hl=en">View and edit</a> your preferences about the ads shown to you on Google and across the web, such as which categories might interest you, using Ads Settings. You can also opt out of certain Google advertising services here.

3.1.=[Z/Sec/s5]

3.2.sec=You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set by us. However, it's important to remember that many of our services <a class="highlight" href="../../policies/privacy/example/may-not-function-properly.html" id="may-not-function-properly">may not function properly</a> if your cookies are disabled. For example, we may not remember your language preferences.

3.=[Z/Sec/s2]

4.Ti=Information you share

If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it - unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.

5.2.sec=We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).

5.3.sec=Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.
