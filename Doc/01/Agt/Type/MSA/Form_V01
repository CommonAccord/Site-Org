Comp.Taxes.Sec={P2.Handle}&rsquo;s price for the {Services} includes all sovereign, state and local sales, use, excise, privilege, payroll and/or occupational taxes, any value added tax that is not recoverable by {P1.Handle} and any other taxes, fees, and/or duties applicable to the goods and/or {Services} purchased under this Order.&#8194; If {P2.Handle} is obligated by law to charge any value added and/or similar tax to {P1.Handle}, {P2.Handle} shall ensure that if such value-added and/or similar tax is applicable, that it is invoiced to {P1.Handle} in accordance with applicable rules so as to allow {P1.Handle} to reclaim such value-added and/or similar tax from the appropriate government authority.&#8194; Neither party is responsible for taxes on the other party&rsquo;s income or the income of the other party&rsquo;s personnel or subcontractors.&#8194; If {P1.Handle} is required by government regulation to withhold taxes for which {P2.Handle} is responsible, {P1.Handle} will deduct such withholding tax from payment to {P2.Handle} and provide to {P2.Handle} a valid tax receipt in {P2.Handle}&rsquo;s name.&#8194; If {P2.Handle} is exempt from such withholding taxes as a result of a tax treaty or other regime, {P2.Handle} shall provide to {P1.Handle} a valid tax treaty residency certificate or other tax exemption certificate at a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to payment being due.

Comp.Due.Sec=All payment terms under {this Agreement} are net due {Payment.DueAfter.Days} from the {Payment Start Date}.&#8194; The {Payment Start Date} is the later of the required date identified on the applicable {PO}, the received date of the {Services} in {P1.Handle}&rsquo;s receiving system or the date of receipt of valid invoice by {P1.Handle}.&#8194; The received date of the {Services} in {P1.Handle}&rsquo;s receiving system will occur within forty eight (48) hours of {P1.Handle} receiving confirmation that the {Services} have been provided in accordance with the applicable {PO} or {SOW}.

Comp.EarlyDiscount.Sec=<b>Early Discount.</b><br>  {Comp.EarlyDiscount.Base.Sen}&#8194; {Comp.EarlyDiscount.PrimeRate.Sen}&#8194; {Comp.EarlyDiscount.Weekend.Sen}&#8194; {Comp.EarlyDiscount.TitleViaFinance.Sen}

Comp.EarlyDiscount.Base.Sen={P1.Handle} shall be entitled to take an early payment discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.%} of the gross invoice price (&ldquo;{Daily Discount Rate}&rdquo;) for each day before {Payment.DueAfter.Days} from the {Payment Start Date} that payment is made.&#8194; For example, a discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.1.%} would correspond to payment made {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.1.Days} early and a discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.2.%} would correspond to payment made {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.2.Days} early.&#8194; The {Daily Discount Rate} has been calculated based on a {Prime Rate} (defined below) of {Base.Prime.Rate.%} (&ldquo;{Base Prime Rate}&rdquo;).&#8194; If the {Prime Rate} in effect on the last business day of any month exceeds the {Base Prime Rate}, the {Daily Discount Rate} will be adjusted on such date by 0.0007% for every twenty five (25) basis points that the {Prime Rate} in effect on such date exceeds the {Base Prime Rate}; provided, however, that if the {Prime Rate} ever falls below the {Base Prime Rate}, then the {Daily Base Discount Rate} will remain {EarlyPaymentDiscount.%}.&#8194; If the {Daily Base Discount Rate} is adjusted on the last business day of the month as set forth above, then such adjusted {Daily Base Discount Rate} will be applicable to all invoices posted for payment during the following month.

Comp.EarlyDiscount.PrimeRate.Sen=For purposes of this Section, &ldquo;{Prime Rate}&rdquo; shall be the Prime Rate as published in the &ldquo;Money Rates&rdquo; section of The Wall Street Journal (or, in the event that such rate is not so published, as published in another nationally recognized publication) on the last business day of each month.&#8194; For example, if the {Prime Rate} exceeds the {Base Prime Rate} by 0.25%, on the last day of the month, the {Daily Base Discount Rate} for the following month will increase by 0.0007%.&#8194; Thus, a discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.3.%} would correspond to payment made ten (10) days early (i.e., one hundred and ten (110) days from the {Payment Start Date}).

/Note=In the original they switch to "Buyer" and "Seller".  An error, right?

Comp.EarlyDiscount.Weekend.Sen=If the date Buyer uses to calculate the early payment discount falls on a weekend or a holiday, payment to Seller will be made on the next business day with the full discount taken as if the payment had been made to Seller on such weekend or holiday date.

Comp.EarlyDiscount.TitleViaFinance.Sen=Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Order, if Buyer elects to take the early payment discount to settle an invoice, Seller acknowledges and confirms that: <ol><li>title to the goods and services shall pass directly to {P1.FinanceWing.Name} ("{P1.FinanceWing.Handle}") in accordance with the terms of this Order;</li><li>once title to the goods and services has passed to {P1.FinanceWing.Handle}, {P1.FinanceWing.Handle} shall immediately and directly transfer such title to Buyer; and</li><li>any and all of the obligations, including representations and warranties Seller has provided with respect to the goods and services, shall be retained by Buyer, and Buyer may rely upon the same.</li></ol>

Comp.SetOff.Sec={P1.Handle} shall be entitled at all times to set off any amount owing at any time from {P2.Handle} to {P1.Handle} or its Affiliates in connection with this or any other agreement between {P2.Handle} and {P1.Handle} or {P1 Affiliates}.

Comp.Audit.Sec=During the {Term} and for three (3) years thereafter, {P2.Handle} shall, at {P1.Handle}&rsquo;s request and without any additional charge, provide full and complete access during normal business hours to the offices, books and records of {P2.Handle} and its accountants for purposes of auditing any performance (including without limit employee screening and environmental compliance), compensation or reimbursement issue under {this Agreement}.
