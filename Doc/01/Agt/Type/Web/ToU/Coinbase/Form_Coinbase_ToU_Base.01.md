You further agree that any disputes between you and {P1_Handle} will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</strong>

0.4.0.sec=Please note the following risks of using {P1_Services}:

0.4.1.sec=Once submitted to the {Bitcoin_network}, a {Bitcoin_Transaction} (defined below) will be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or more) pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the {Bitcoin_network}. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Bitcoin associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your {P1_Account} balance or be available to conduct transactions.

0.4.2.sec=The risk of loss in trading or holding bitcoin can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding bitcoin is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold bitcoin, you should be aware that the price or value of bitcoin can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. If you use a {P1_Handle} product which allows you and/or third parties to access and hold bitcoin private keys, you acknowledge that {P1_Handle} is not responsible for safeguarding such keys and that {P1_Handle} is not responsible for any loss of bitcoin resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of bitcoin private keys outside its control.

2.1.Ti=Registration of {P1_Account}

2.1.sec=In order to use any of the {P1_Services}, you must first register by providing your name, an e-mail address, password, and affirming your acceptance of {this_Agreement}. Upon successful completion of the registration process, {P1_Handle} will establish your {P1_Account}. {P1_Handle} may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a {P1_Account}, or limit the number of {P1_Accounts} that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.

2.2.Ti=Identity Verification

2.2.sec=In order to use certain features of the {P1_Services}, including certain transfers of bitcoin and/or currency, you may be required to provide {P1_Handle} with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number). {P1_Handle} may also require you to answer certain questions or take actions in order to verify your identity, provide the {P1_Services} to you, or comply with applicable law. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update {P1_Handle} if any information changes. <strong>You hereby authorize {P1_Handle} to, directly or through third parties make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including to query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth), to query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance), and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports.

3.1.Ti=Sending and Receiving Bitcoin.</h3>

3.1.1.sec=As part of the services offered in connection with your {P1_Account}, {P1_Handle} can help you send bitcoin to, and request and receive bitcoin from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the {P1_Site} (each such transaction is a "{Bitcoin_Transaction}"). You may initiate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} by going to the {P1_Site}, choosing to send or request, and entering the requisite information regarding the sender or recipient and the amount of bitcoin to be transferred. {P1_Handle} will then communicate with the {Bitcoin_network} on your behalf, as necessary, to facilitate each {Bitcoin_Transaction} in accordance with these instructions.

3.1.2.sec={P1_Handle} reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending {Bitcoin_Transaction} as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order. {P1_Handle} cannot reverse a {Bitcoin_Transaction} which has been communicated to and confirmed by the {Bitcoin_network}.

3.1.3.sec={P1_Handle} processes {Bitcoin_Transactions} according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to {P1_Handle} as the relevant {Bitcoin_Transaction} may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated.

3.1.4.sec=If you initiate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} by entering the recipient's bitcoin address, {P1_Handle} will confirm that the bitcoin address is valid; however, {P1_Handle} cannot confirm that the bitcoin address belongs to the intended recipient. In the event you initiate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} by entering the recipient's email address and the recipient does not have an existing {P1_Account}, {P1_Handle} will email the recipient and invite them to open a {P1_Account}. If the designated recipient does not open a {P1_Account} within 30 days, {P1_Handle} will return the bitcoin associated with the transaction to your {P1_Account}.

3.1.=[02/Bit/Ssec_04]


3.2.Ti=Bitcoin Storage & Transmission Delays

3.2.sec={P1_Handle} securely stores 100% of all bitcoin private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for {P1_Handle} to retrieve this information from offline storage in order to facilitate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such {Bitcoin_Transaction} for 48 hours or more. As a user of the {P1_Services}, you accept the risk that a {Bitcoin_Transaction} facilitated by {P1_Handle} may be delayed and you agree not to hold {P1_Handle} responsible for any damages or injury arising out of or related to such delay.

3.3.Ti=Your {Bitcoin_Transactions}.

3.3.1.Ti=Third Party Transactions

3.3.1.sec={P1_Handle} has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of {P1_Services}). {P1_Handle} is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with bitcoin transferred using the {P1_Services}, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must handle it directly with that third party. Due to the nature of bitcoin, any {Bitcoin_Transaction} conducted using the {P1_Services} is final regardless of any defects in or non-delivery of any goods or services purchased in connection with such {Bitcoin_Transaction}, or any other aspect of your transaction or relationship with the relevant third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify {P1_Handle} Support at <a href="mailto:support@{P1_com}">support@{P1_com}</a> so that we may consider whether to take any action.

3.3.2.Ti=Refunds

3.3.2.sec={P1_Handle} is not responsible for merchant refund policies. Certain merchants may wish to process a refund to you via a separate {Bitcoin_Transaction} having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in local currency (e.g., U.S. dollars), based on the then current {Conversion_Rate}. As a result, you may receive less (or more) bitcoin via a refund than you initially used to pay the {Merchant}.

3.3.3.Ti=Taxes

3.3.3.sec=It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions associated with your receipt or transfer of bitcoin, and/or to the {Bitcoin_Transactions} you conduct through the {P1_Services}, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your {P1_Account}.

3.3.=[02/Bit/Sec_03]


3.4.Ti=Limits

3.4.sec={P1_Handle} reserves the right to change the buy/sell, transfer, trading, storage and velocity limits applicable to your {Bitcoin_Wallet} in our sole discretion. We may require you to provide us with information about yourself and/or your {Bitcoin_Transactions} if your transactions exceed certain government reporting thresholds, such as thresholds regarding financial recordkeeping and tax reporting.

3.5.Ti={P1_Vault}

3.5.1.sec=You may elect to add heightened controls to your {Bitcoin_Wallet} by transferring bitcoin to a special account designated for this purpose (the "{P1_Vault}"). The basic {P1_Vault} allows users to set time-delays which prohibit transfer of associated bitcoin within a designated period following a transfer instruction, and/or to require the electronic approval of multiple individuals designated by the user before transfers may be completed. Any bitcoin associated with the basic {P1_Vault} cannot be transferred until the time-delay period lapses or the requisite multi-party approval is obtained or both.

3.5.2.sec=An advanced {P1_Vault} allows users the option to view, control, and distribute private keys of associated bitcoin to multiple third parties whose majority approval will be required to transfer associated bitcoin (the "{Multisig_Vault}"). Although {P1_Handle} may, at the user's election, create encrypted backups of such private keys, these backups cannot be restored without a user-generated password. <strong>{P1_Handle} cannot restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys which are not within {P1_Handle}'s control. Users of the {Multisig_Vault} acknowledge that {P1_Handle} is not responsible for transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining private keys and bitcoin associated with a user's {Multisig_Vault}.</strong> Only the user, with approval of requisite co-signers (if any), can transfer bitcoin associated with a {Multisig_Vault}. If you and/or co-signing authorities lose, mishandle, or have stolen associated bitcoin private keys, or if your cosigners refuse to provide requisite authority, you acknowledge that you may not be able to recover associated bitcoin, and that {P1_Handle} is not responsible for such loss.

3.5.=[02/Bit/Ssec_02]


3.6.Ti=Customized {P1_Handle} Payment Page

3.6.sec=You can use your {P1_Account} to establish a customizable payment page ("Payment Page") which will allow others to easily send bitcoin to your {Bitcoin_Wallet}. You may establish and customize your Payment Page through your {P1_Account} settings, which will allow you to establish a user handle and associated Payments Page URL, upload a photo, and provide a short description. In establishing your Payment Page and uploading or adding any text, photo, or other material, you agree that you will not (<em>i</em>) post misleading materials or misappropriate the identity of another person or entity, (<em>ii</em>) post any copyrighted material which you are not authorized to post, or (<em>iii</em>) post any profane, unlawful, or offensive materials. {P1_Handle}, in its sole discretion, may disable your Payment Page and take other action in accordance with {this_Agreement} if we believe you are in violation of the foregoing or abusing this service. {P1_Handle} may reclaim user handles associated with dormant {P1_Accounts}. {P1_Handle} does not guarantee or endorse the purported identity, message, or other information posted by a user to the user's Payment Page.

3.7.Ti=Advanced Protocols

3.7.sec=We do not currently support metacoins, colored coins, or any advanced protocol which supplements the core Bitcoin Protocol. {P1_Handle} does not detect whether {Bitcoin_Transactions} associated with your {P1_Account} may involve any such protocol use. Do not use your {P1_Account} to effect any instruction or transfer involving an advanced protocol. {P1_Handle} is not responsible for any loss which may result from such use.

3.=[02/Bit/Sec_07]


4.Ti={Conversion_Service}

4.1.Ti=Transactions with {P1_Handle}

4.1.sec=When buying or selling bitcoin through the {Conversion_Service}, you are buying from, or selling to, {P1_Handle} directly. {P1_Handle} does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin. The {Conversion_Service} is subject to the {P1_Handle} "{Conversion_Rate}." "{Conversion_Rate}" means the liquidity adjusted price of a given bitcoin amount in terms of local currency as quoted on the {P1_Site}. The {Conversion_Rate} is stated either as a "Buy Price," the price in terms of local currency at which you purchase bitcoin from {P1_Handle}, or as a "Sell Price," the price in terms of local currency at which you sell bitcoin to {P1_Handle}. For the purpose of any transaction which incorporates the {Conversion_Rate}, you agree, as a condition of using any {P1_Services}, to accept the {Conversion_Rate} as the sole conversion metric.

4.2.Ti=Bitcoin Purchases

4.2.sec=After successfully completing the verification steps described in the [Verification Procedures] (#toc_10) set forth below, you may purchase bitcoin from {P1_Handle}, subject to applicable daily limits. {P1_Handle} will instruct its bank to initiate a debit to your primary payment method or directly from your {USD_Wallet}, or, if the payment is not successful, to any payment method you have on file, in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of bitcoin you wish to purchase multiplied by the Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you initiate the transaction, plus (b) the applicable {Conversion_Fee} (defined below), plus (c) additional fees as may apply in the event that {P1_Handle} cannot draw funds from your payment method and must charge a backup payment method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, {P1_Handle} will provide a date by which your bitcoin will be made available in your {Bitcoin_Wallet}, which may depend on the time required for {P1_Handle} to receive funds from your payment method. If your bitcoin purchase is marked as complete or pending in your {Bitcoin_Wallet}, such transaction cannot be cancelled, reversed or changed. In connection with any purchase of bitcoin from {P1_Handle}, {P1_Handle} will use good faith efforts to fulfill such purchase order at the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you place such order. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for {P1_Handle} to delay fulfillment of a purchase order until such time as we are able to execute the transaction. In such cases, we will notify you through the {P1_Site} prior to the completion of your purchase order that the amount of bitcoin that you will receive will be determined based on the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the subsequent point at which {P1_Handle}, with your further approval, may execute your transaction.

4.3.Ti=Sale Transactions

4.3.sec=After successfully completing the verification steps described in the [Verification Procedures] (#toc_10), you may sell bitcoin to {P1_Handle}, subject to the above-referenced daily limits, by instructing {P1_Handle} accordingly. {P1_Handle} will then credit your {USD_Wallet} directly, or instruct its bank to initiate a credit to your linked payout method, in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of bitcoin you wish to sell multiplied by the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you initiate the transaction, minus (b) the applicable {Conversion_Fee} (defined below). {P1_Handle} will then initiate a transfer of the appropriate amount of bitcoin from your {Bitcoin_Wallet} to {P1_Handle}'s own bitcoin wallet, and the related proceeds of funds will thereafter be credited to your linked payout method. The proceeds of any bitcoin sale will be credited to your linked payout method within two to three business days. Upon any sale of bitcoin to {P1_Handle}, all settlements or payments by {P1_Handle} for such transaction shall be paid in local currency (e.g., USD) at the applicable Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you approved the transaction.

4.4.Ti=Limits

4.4.sec={P1_Handle} imposes limits on the number of bitcoin that you may buy, sell, or trade in a given day, as published in the [Verification Procedures] (#toc_10). {P1_Handle} reserves the right to change posted limits as we deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. {P1_Handle} does not guarantee the availability of its {Conversion_Service}, and the act of purchasing bitcoin from {P1_Handle} does not result in a guarantee that you may sell your bitcoin to {P1_Handle}. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the highest-posted amounts, you may submit a request to <a href="mailto:support@{P1_com}">support@{P1_com}</a>. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with {P1_Handle} staff (such process, "{Enhanced_Due_Diligence}"). {P1_Handle} reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with {Enhanced_Due_Diligence}, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed {Enhanced_Due_Diligence}.

4.5.Ti={Conversion_Fee}

4.5.sec=Each {Conversion_Service} transaction is subject to a fee (the "{Conversion_Fee}", sometimes also referred to as an "Exchange Fee") charged by {P1_Handle} which consists of: (a) a fee for the conversion of local currency (e.g., USD) for bitcoin (or vice versa) which is calculated as a percentage of the local currency to be converted, plus (b) a fixed transfer fee which may be applied to cover applicable bank fees. If you use your linked bank account to effect a conversion, the transfer fee is nominal - approximately $0.15 -netted out of your settlement to or from {P1_Handle}. Payments using other methods, such as wire or credit card (if permitted), are subject to higher fees. {P1_Handle} will not process a conversion if the fixed transfer fee exceeds the value of your transaction. The fixed transfer fee does not apply to Conversions involving funds in your {USD_Wallet}. The current {Conversion_Fee} is displayed on the {P1_Site} prior to you completing a {Conversion_Service} transaction. Your bank may charge you a non-sufficient funds ("NSF") fee or overdraft fee in the event that you do not have sufficient funds to complete a transaction.

4.6.Ti=Payments

4.6.1.sec=You agree to deliver payment for any bitcoin purchase made through the {Conversion_Service} upon confirmation of an order, regardless of changes in the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate prior to completion of the purchase transaction, with such payment to be made in good funds in the amount calculated in the manner specified herein.

4.6.2.sec=If there are insufficient funds from your linked primary payment method to cover the purchase price of any bitcoin order or any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder, you hereby authorize us to debit any of your payment methods which have been linked to your {P1_Account} for the full or partial amount of your purchase and any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder. We may resubmit debits or charges to your payment methods until all amounts owed by you to us hereunder are satisfied in full. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance in each of your accounts and sufficient credit limits on your credit cards in order to avoid any overdraft, NSF or similar fees. To secure the performance of your obligations under {this_Agreement}, you grant to {P1_Handle} a security interest in any and all of your funds or other property which come into the possession of {P1_Handle} and the bitcoin associated with your {P1_Account}. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.

4.6.3.sec=We may deduct any bitcoin held by you in a {Bitcoin_Wallet} if a payment for a purchase of bitcoin using a bank account or credit card is subsequently reversed, for example, if such a payment is subject to a chargeback, reversal, claim or is otherwise invalidated. We may also deduct bitcoin held by you in a {Bitcoin_Wallet} in satisfaction of any outstanding amount owed by you to {P1_Handle} under {this_Agreement}.

4.6.4.sec={P1_Handle} reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases or sales of bitcoin in its sole discretion, including but not limited to instances where {P1_Handle} suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if {P1_Handle} suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below.

5.1.Ti={USD_Wallets}

5.1.sec=Users who have verified their Identity with {P1_Handle} and who reside in approved jurisdictions may establish and fund a U.S. Dollar balance ("{USD_Wallet}"). Except as otherwise set forth herein, you may use your {USD_Wallet} only to purchase bitcoin from {P1_Handle}, to receive the proceeds of bitcoin sales to {P1_Handle}, or to transfer funds to and from a {P1_Handle} {Trading_Account}. {P1_Handle} holds all customers' {USD_Wallet} funds in a dedicated account at an FDIC-insured financial institution.

5.2.Ti=Deposits and Withdrawals

5.2.sec=You may visit your {Account} at {P1_com}/accounts and click on "{USD_Wallet}" to transfer funds between your linked bank account and {P1_Handle} as necessary to deposit funds into or withdraw funds from your {USD_Wallet}. {P1_Handle} will not charge a fee for you to transfer funds to or from {P1_Handle}, but bank transfer fees may apply. Funds sent via bank wire (if permitted by {P1_Handle}) are subject to additional wire fees. For deposits, {P1_Handle} will credit your {USD_Wallet} a corresponding amount of dollars after funds are delivered to {P1_Handle}, typically within two to three business days after you authorize a deposit. For withdrawals, {P1_Handle} will immediately debit your {USD_Wallet} when you authorize a withdrawal and funds will typically settle to you within two to three business days. Bank fees are netted out of transfers to or from {P1_Handle}. We will not process a transfer if associated bank fees exceed the value of the transfer.

5.3.Ti={USD_Wallet} Transactions

5.3.sec=When you purchase bitcoin, you may opt to use funds in your {USD_Wallet} rather than your linked payment method. If you purchase bitcoin using your {USD_Wallet}, {P1_Handle} will ordinarily effect an immediate settlement of funds, with bitcoin credited to your {Bitcoin_Wallet}, although {P1_Handle} reserves the right to delay any such transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity. When you sell bitcoin to {P1_Handle}, you may elect to receive the proceeds of such sale into your {USD_Wallet}. {P1_Handle} will ordinarily effect an immediate settlement of funds, with U.S. Dollars credited to your {USD_Wallet}, although {P1_Handle} reserves the right to delay any such transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity.

5.4.Ti=Limits

5.4.sec=You may not initiate a deposit which exceeds your daily bitcoin buy limits. {P1_Handle} reserves the right to restrict deposits into your {USD_Wallet} and/or to require you to withdraw funds from your {USD_Wallet} if {P1_Handle} determines that your {USD_Wallet} has reached an excessive balance. You may not purchase or sell bitcoin in excess of your daily buy / sell limits, set forth below, regardless of the amount of funds held in your {USD_Wallet}.
