Ti=EFF's Copyright Policy

1.Ti=Creative Commons

1.1.Sec=Creative Commons License Any and all original material on the EFF website may be freely distributed at will under the Creative Commons Attribution License, unless otherwise noted. All material that is not original to EFF may require permission from the copyright holder to redistribute.

1.2.Sec=You do NOT have to ask permission to post original EFF material on a mailing list or newsgroup, to use an EFF logo as a pointer to us on your web site, or to reprint an EFF statement in a newspaper article. Permission to do such things is explicitly granted. Please do not write to us asking for permission, as this wastes our time and yours.

1.3.Sec=If you redistribute something you got from the EFF site, it is appreciated if you make it known where the file originated, so people can get more info or updated versions.

2.Ti=Copyright Infringement Notification

2.1.0.Sec=If you believe there is content on the EFF website that violates copyright law, let us know. Specifically, send us an email or letter that includes substantially the following:

2.1.1.Sec=A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

2.1.2.Sec=Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site.

2.1.3.Sec=Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to locate the material.

2.1.4.Sec=Information reasonably sufficient to permit the service provider to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted.

2.1.5.Sec=A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

2.1.6.Sec=A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

2.2.Sec=The notice should be sent to our designated agent, Corynne McSherry, via email (dmca-notice@eff.org) or fax (415-436-9993).

2.3.Sec=We may display a copy of your DMCA notice in place of the removed content.

2.4.Sec=Note: Under Section 512(f) of the DMCA, any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability for damages. One company that sent an infringement notification seeking removal of online materials that were protected by the fair use doctrine was ordered to pay such costs and attorneys fees under this provision. See http://www.eff.org/cases/online-policy-group-v-diebold. In addition, "in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the DMCA with "a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law," the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright." Lenz v. Universal, 572 F. Supp. 2d 1150, 1155 (2008)

2.5.Sec=EFF reserves the right to review the allegedly infringing material and independently determine whether it is infringing.

2.6.Sec=Please also note that the information provided in this legal notice will be forwarded to the person who provided the allegedly infringing content. A copy of this legal notice may also be sent (with your personal information removed) to a third-party that may publish and/or annotate it for noncommercial research and educational purposes.
