Ti=Suspension and Removals

1.Ti=Suspension/Removals

1.sec=If {P2.Handle} becomes aware that any {Application}, {Project} (including an {End_User}'s use of a {Project}), or {P2_Data} violates the {AUP}, {P2.Handle} will immediately suspend the {Application} or {Project} (if applicable), remove the applicable {P2_Data} or suspend access to an {End_User} (as may be applicable).  If {P2.Handle} fails to suspend or remove as noted in the prior sentence, {P1.Handle} may specifically request that {P2.Handle} do so.  If {P2.Handle} fails to comply with {P1.Handle}'s request to do so within twenty-four hours, then {P1.Handle} may suspend {P1.Handle} accounts of the applicable {End_Users}, disable the {Project} or {Application}, and/or disable the {Account} (as may be applicable) until such violation is corrected.


2.Ti={Emergency_Security_Issues}

2.sec=Despite the foregoing, if there is an {Emergency_Security_Issue}, then {P1.Handle} may automatically suspend the offending {End_User} account, {Application}, {Project}, or the {Account}.  Suspension will be to the minimum extent required, and of the minimum duration, to prevent or terminate the {Emergency_Security_Issue}.  If {P1.Handle} suspends an {End_User} account, {Application}, {Project}, or the {Account}, for any reason, without prior notice to {P2.Handle}, at {P2.Handle}'s request, {P1.Handle} will provide {P2.Handle} the reason for the suspension as soon as is reasonably possible.
