Either party may call an Emergency Meeting during the pendency of the dispute resolution proceeding to discuss the Change Order, the performance of the Services and the adjusted Project Plan, schedule and FP of the Task Order during which Emergency Meeting the parties will continue to work to reach mutual agreement. It is recognized that not all Required Changes will result in an increase in the FP of a Task Order, but both parties acknowledge and agree that if a Required Change causes an increase in the cost of performance of a Task Order and/or requires additional or different time for delivery of Services, the FP of a Task Order will be equitably adjusted and/or the schedule will be equitably extended (as applicable).

The Project Plan and schedule may be adjusted as necessary based upon Contractor's reasonable business judgment during the pendency of the dispute resolution. Either party may call an Emergency Meeting during the pendency of the dispute resolution proceeding to discuss the Change Order, the performance of the Services, and/or any adjusted Project Plan, FP and schedule during which Emergency Meeting the parties will continue to work to reach mutual agreement. Upon completion of the dispute resolution proceedings, the parties shall enter into a Change Order in accordance with the dispute resolution determination that equitably compensates Contractor for the Services performed as a result of the Client Delay and equitably adjusts the Project schedule. All Services resulting from the Client Delay shall be tailored in accordance with the decision resulting from resolution of the dispute. For clarity's sake, the amount of Fees paid to Contractor during the pendency of the dispute resolution shall reduce the amount of Fees that Contractor may collect with regard to the Client Delay. It is recognized that not all Client Delays will result in an increase in the FP of a Task Order, but both parties acknowledge and agree that if a Client Delay causes an increase in the cost of performance of a Task Order or requires additional or different time for delivery of Services, the FP of the Task Order will be equitably adjusted and/or the schedule will be equitably extended (as applicable).

7.6.Sec=Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client may submit a Change Request to reduce the Scope by notifying Contractor that Client will not require delivery of specified Services, provided, that a reduction in Scope shall be deemed a termination for convenience by Client, in part, of this Agreement.
