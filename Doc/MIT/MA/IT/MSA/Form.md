6.Ti=THIRD PARTY VENDORS.

6.1.Ti=Subcontractors

6.1.1.sec=Client and Contractor acknowledge and agree that third-party Advisers or other third-party providers (collectively, "Third Party Vendors") may, from time to time, provide Third Party Software, Third Party Equipment or Third Party Services in support of the Project; provided, however, that any Services provided by Contractor's Affiliates or by staff augmentation contractors shall not constitute Third Party Services, and Contractor's Affiliates and staff augmentation contractors shall not constitute Third Party Vendors provided that Contractor shall remain responsible for all acts and omissions of Contractor's Affiliates and staff augmentation contractors. Any Third Party Services provided by a Subcontractor must be provided under a Subcontract complying with this Section 6.1. Client and Contractor agree that Contractor will serve as the prime contractor for each Subcontract, and will remain responsible for the performance of any Services provided by any such Subcontractor. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Third Party Vendors are providing Client Provided Third Party Software, Client Provided Third Party Services and/or Client Provided Third Party Equipment, such Third Party Vendors are not Subcontractors. Client may enter into agreements directly with Third Party Vendors for the Services specified in the Task Orders, and no such agreement shall be construed to discharge Contractor from its obligations or liabilities to Client under this Agreement and with respect to the performance of all Services, except as expressly stated herein.

6.1.2.0.sec=Contractor shall:

6.1.2.1.sec=submit each proposed Subcontractor to Client for written approval, and obtain Client's written approval (in each case, such approval or disapproval shall not be unreasonably delayed), prior to engaging any such Subcontractor to provide Third Party Services, Third Party Software or27 Third Party Equipment under this Agreement. Client's failure to approve or disapprove a proposed Subcontractor on a timely basis shall be considered a Client Delay for the applicable Services to be provided by the proposed Subcontractor if Client's failure adversely impacts Contractor's ability to meet a Task Order delivery date related to the work proposed to be completed by the proposed Subcontractor;

6.1.2.2.0.sec=with regard to Subcontracts with Third Party Vendors that will provide Third Party Services, execute a Subcontract that:

6.1.2.2.1.sec=is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement;

6.1.2.2.2.sec=unless otherwise agreed by Client in writing, requires the Subcontractor to be bound by the Flowdown Terms;

6.1.2.2.3.sec=unless otherwise agreed by Client in writing, provides that the Subcontract may be assigned to Client at Client's request (however, Client shall not require such right to assign if Contractor can demonstrate it has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such ability to assign, and the proposed Subcontractor (I) has refused to provide the right to assign, (II) is the only source for the Third Party Service and (III) has not accepted the Commonwealth Terms in a current engagement); and

6.1.2.2.4.sec=permits Client, at Client's sole discretion, to, upon written notice to Contractor, pay directly to the Subcontractor any amounts owed by Contractor to such Subcontractor under the Subcontract, in the event that (I) Contractor has not paid such Subcontractor and the continued nonpayment of such Subcontractor materially compromises the Project or any System or (II) Contractor commences, or has commenced against it, proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor's relief law, which proceedings are not dismissed within thirty (30) days;

6.1.2.2.=[Bit/Ssec_04]

6.1.2.3.sec=with regard to Subcontracts with Third Party Vendors that will provide Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment, utilize commercially reasonable efforts to execute a Subcontract that (A) is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, (B) incorporates the Commonwealth Terms and Commonwealth Standard Form Contract (C) may be assigned upon Client's request and (D) provides that the Third Party Vendor must indemnify Client for intellectual property infringement claims arising from the Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment;

6.1.2.4.sec=obtain Client's prior written consent to the terms of any Subcontract with a Key Subcontractor (in each case, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For avoidance of doubt, Client's consent to the terms of any such Subcontract shall in no event be28 construed to waive, modify, amend or in any way alter the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

6.1.2.5.sec=be responsible for managing each such Subcontractor's performance under this Agreement;

6.1.2.6.sec=continue to be responsible for the performance of the Services required by this Agreement, notwithstanding such Subcontractor's performance (irrespective of any terms or limitations or exclusions of the Subcontract);

6.1.2.7.sec=(vii) if such right exists, Contractor shall assign a Subcontract to Client upon Client's request;

6.1.2.8.sec=provide Client with copies of all draft Subcontracts with Key Subcontractors with an opportunity to review and comment prior to signing and final executed Subcontracts; and

6.1.2.9.sec=defend, indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any and all third party claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to Contractor's failure to pay any Subcontractor, including any claim made by any Subcontractor against Client alleging nonpayment by Contractor. Unless and until a Subcontract is assigned to Client as described herein, Client shall not be required to seek a remedy against any Subcontractor (other than with respect to intellectual property infringement, as described below). However, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or a Task Order but without limiting Contractor's obligations under subsection (b) above, (A) except for Key Subcontracts, to the extent permitted by the Subcontract, Client agrees to first seek available remedies for intellectual property infringement claims arising from Client's use of the Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment directly from the Third Party Vendor and (B) following the assignment of a Subcontract to Client, if such assignment occurs, Client shall seek remedy related to and regarding such Subcontract against the Third Party Vendor and not against Contractor for claims arising under such Subcontract after the effective date of the assignment. Except in the event of the assignment by Contractor to Client of a Subcontract pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and except with regard to applicable use restrictions, including but not limited to license use restrictions and confidentiality, set forth in COTS maintenance, Software, license and hardware agreements between Contractor and Third Party Vendors for Third Party Software and/or Third Party Equipment provided by Contractor, in each case as reviewed and approved by Client in advance in writing, Client shall not be bound by any provisions contained in a Subcontract to which it is not a party. As of the Effective Date, hCentive is the only Key Subcontractor. For the avoidance of doubt, the agreement between hCentive and Contractor, a copy of which is attached hereto (for ease of reference purposes only) as Exhibit U (the29 "hCentive Agreement") is a Subcontract hereunder and shall be subject to all the requirements of Section 6.1(b). Within five (5) days after initial deployment to Client of the hCentive Software, and within five (5) days after deployment to Client of each Release (as defined in Exhibit B-3 (Task Order 3)), Contractor will deliver or caused to be delivered to Client the archive copy of the object code for hCentive Software and such copy will be maintained in Client's own storage system.

6.1.2.5.sec=Except for Key Subcontractors, Client and Contractor acknowledge that certain Subcontracts for Third Party Software and Third Party Equipment may not be executed prior to and/or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. Client and Contractor also acknowledge that during the Term of this Agreement, Contractor may propose additional Subcontractors.

6.2.Ti=Termination of Subcontract

6.2.sec=In the event Contractor receives a notice of termination from any Key Subcontractor under any Subcontract, Contractor shall promptly notify Client of such notice of termination. If the parties agree (which may be determined by Emergency Meeting) that the Project would be best served by such Key Subcontractor continuing to perform under such Subcontract, Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such termination, and Contractor shall promptly mitigate any damages that may be incurred by Client as a result of the termination of the Subcontract. The termination of any Subcontract shall not eliminate or reduce Contractor's obligations. In the event any Subcontract with a Key Subcontractor is terminated during the Term, Contractor shall promptly notify Client of such termination and (a) promptly locate a suitable replacement for such Key Subcontractor (which replacement, for clarity, will be subject to Client's written approval in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(iv) above), if necessary, in order to meet Contractor's obligation under this Agreement or (b) obtain the rights to any technology, know-how, expertise, labor, Personnel or any other rights that may be necessary to fulfill the obligations of Contractor under this Agreement, including any obligations that were delegated to such Key Subcontractor. Any such replacement Key Subcontractor must fulfill all of the applicable requirements set forth in this Agreement hereunder.

6.3.Ti=Assignment of Subcontracts

6.3.sec=With respect to Subcontracts that are assignable to Client upon Client's request as required under Section 6.1(b) above, within thirty (30) days of Client's request that Contractor assign to Client such a Subcontract hereunder, or such other time period as mutually agreed by the parties, Contractor shall transfer, assign and convey to Client, by means of a written assignment agreement in such form reasonably satisfactory to Client, all the rights, title and interest of Assignor in, to and under such Subcontract, and delegate to Client all of Contractor's future obligations and liabilities under the Subcontract. Following an assignment of a Subcontract by Contractor to Client pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Third Party Vendor shall no longer be a Subcontractor under this Agreement and Contractor shall not be responsible for the future performance of such Third Party Vendor. For avoidance of doubt, Contractor shall continue to be responsible for all claims of any kind or nature of Subcontractor or arising from such Subcontract that accrued prior to the effective date of the assignment of the Subcontract to Client.

6.4.Ti=Client Agreements With Third Party Vendors

6.4.sec=Client may enter into written agreements directly with Third Party Vendors for Client Provided Third Party Services such as hosting services, Client Provided Third Party Software and Client Provided Third Party Equipment, as specified in a Task Order (or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties). While Contractor shall assist in the management, coordination and communication with such Third Party Vendors, if and to the extent such agreement between Client and the Third Party Vendor allows Contractor to provide such support, Contractor shall not be responsible for the performance of such Third Party Vendors engaged directly by Client, or the Acceptance or performance of any such Client Provided Third Party Software, Client Provided Third Equipment or Client Provided Third Party Services unless such Third Party Vendors have been recommended by Contractor.

7.Ti=QUALITY CONTROL

7.sec=Unless otherwise expressly set forth in a Task Order, Contractor shall establish and maintain throughout the Term of this Agreement quality control standards for Software development, configuration and integration (including methods and techniques) that are consistent with the generally accepted industry practices employed in the systems integration industry for projects of similar scope and size. Client may conduct a quality control review at reasonable times throughout the development and implementation phases of each Task Order to review and coordinate progress of the overall development and implementation of each System in accordance with the agreed-upon standards and in order for Client to determine whether the Project quality standards have been met. Such review may include, but is not limited to, design review, code review, architectural review, system performance review or a general review of any Deliverables and Project Works. 

8.Ti=DELIVERY; EVALUATION AND ACCEPTANCE; DELAYS; LIQUIDATED DAMAGES

8.1.Ti=Applicability

8.1.sec=Unless otherwise expressly set forth in a Task Order, the provisions of this Section 8 shall apply only to FP Task Orders.

8.2.Ti=Critical Milestone Schedule

8.2.sec=Contractor shall perform the Services and deliver each of the Deliverables on or before the delivery date set forth in each applicable Task Order schedule. Deliverables will be delivered to Client's electronic repository in accordance with Section 5.12. The delivery dates and Critical Milestone Schedule shall be revised only pursuant to a mutually agreed Change Order. 

8.3.Ti=Acceptance Criteria

8.3.sec=As part of the development of each Task Order, Contractor and Client shall develop objective Acceptance Criteria that are based upon and include the Task Order Requirements and refine and clarify the quality assurance principles and quality control standards set forth in the Task Order. Such Acceptance Criteria shall be reasonably designed to verify that the Services and Deliverables under such Task Order meet the applicable Requirements. These objective Acceptance Criteria shall be incorporated into the applicable Task Order. Client and Contractor agree that additional quality review processes and additional quality Acceptance Criteria to be applied to specific Deliverables may be mutually agreed to by the parties and set forth in the applicable Task Order. 

8.4.Ti=Acceptance Process

8.4.1.Ti=Project Works

8.4.1.sec=The parties acknowledge and agree that Project Works are not subject to the formal Acceptance processes described below; however, Contractor agrees that Project Works will be provided in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry-standard practices. Contractor will work with Client regarding Client's concerns that a particular Project Work has not been prepared in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with industry standards.


8.4.2.Ti=Documentation

8.4.2.sec=Contractor shall deliver to Client the applicable Documentation in accordance with each Task Order schedule. Client shall Evaluate such Documentation in accordance with the Evaluation Period prescribed in the applicable Task Order schedule or otherwise agreed in writing by the parties and indicate in writing to Contractor either: (i) its Acceptance of such Documentation; or (ii) its rejection of such Documentation, setting out in reasonable detail the Nonconformities that constitute the basis for rejection. In the case of any Documentation for which no Evaluation Period is prescribed in the Task Order schedule, the timing of Evaluation shall be as set forth below in this Section 8.4, but in all cases Client will use commercially reasonable efforts to Evaluate all Documentation as promptly as possible following delivery or redelivery. When all Nonconformities that constituted the basis for rejection have been Resolved by Contractor, or Client agrees in writing that any of such Nonconformities will not delay Acceptance, Client shall provide Contractor with written notice of its Acceptance of such Documentation. For clarity, not all Documentation will be subject to formal Acceptance in accordance with this Section 8.4, in which case the process described in Section 8.4(a) will apply. Each Task Order shall identify the Documentation, if any, that shall be subject to Acceptance in accordance with this Section 8.4(b). If not otherwise specified in the applicable Task Order, the Acceptance Criteria for Documentation that is subject to Acceptance shall be that the Documentation shall conform in all material respects with the applicable Requirements.

8.4.3.Ti=Software Deliverables Other Than Third Party Software

8.5.3.0.sec=Each Task Order will set forth Acceptance Criteria for Software Deliverables. In the event that a specific Evaluation and Acceptance process is not set forth with respect to any particular Software Deliverable (other than Third Party Software), such Software Deliverable shall be Evaluated and Accepted in accordance with this Section 8.4(c).

8.4.3.1.Ti=Test and Refine

8.4.3.1.sec=Contractor shall test and refine each Software Deliverable in accordance with objective criteria mutually agreed to and set forth in the applicable Task Order. Prior to submission of a Software Deliverable to Client for Acceptance, the parties will schedule and undertake a pre-production (but post-build/implementation) testing period in accordance with pre-production testing criteria mutually agreed to by the parties. Following completion of such pre-production testing, each Software Deliverable shall be Evaluated in accordance with the Acceptance procedures set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii) below. In the event32 that the parties fail to agree upon pre-production testing criteria prior to the date for pre-production testing, the parties will convene an Emergency Meeting to determine the appropriate course of action, and the Joint Project Committee may authorize submission of such Software Deliverable to Client for Evaluation in accordance with the Acceptance procedures set forth in Section 8.4(c)(ii) below.

8.4.3.2.Ti=Acceptance Testing

8.4.3.2.sec=With respect to any Software Deliverable, (1) Contractor shall deliver (or, as applicable, provide access to) the Deliverable to Client for Evaluation and (2) Client shall Evaluate the Deliverable in accordance with the applicable Acceptance Criteria set forth in the applicable Task Order, and indicate in writing to Contractor either (A) its Acceptance of the Software Deliverable or (B) its rejection of the Software Deliverable, in which case Client will also identify the Nonconformities of the Software Deliverable in reasonable detail that are the basis for rejection. Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties in the applicable Task Order or otherwise in writing, if the Software Deliverable is rejected, Contractor shall Resolve all Severity Level 1 Nonconformities, Severity Level 2 Nonconformities and Severity Level 3 Nonconformities and all agreed upon Severity Level 4 Nonconformities as are identified in the Task Orders for Resolution prior to Acceptance, and redeliver the Deliverable to Client for Evaluation. Any failure of the parties to agree to classification of a Nonconformity as either a Severity Level 1, Severity Level 2 or Severity Level 3, shall permit either party to call for an Emergency Meeting in accordance with Section 5.3(e). Contractor may implement a Workaround to Resolve such Nonconformities for Acceptance in accordance with the Acceptance Criteria; provided, however, that unless Client has agreed in writing that the Workaround may constitute a permanent Resolution of a Nonconformity, the Nonconformity must be Resolved prior to the end of the Warranty Period for the applicable System. Upon such redelivery, Client shall Evaluate the Deliverable anew in accordance with this Section 8.4. Acceptance of any Software Deliverable is subject to Contractor's Resolution of such Nonconformities in accordance with this Section 8. If any Nonconformity arises in previously accepted Software Deliverables that is caused by a subsequent Software Deliverable or becomes apparent because of the subsequent Software Deliverable, and prevents any such Software Deliverables (including a System as a whole) from conforming to the relevant Acceptance Criteria, the subsequent Software Deliverable will not be Accepted by Client until the Nonconformities in such Software Deliverable and in the previously Accepted Software Deliverables are Resolved as set forth above in this Section 8.4(c)(ii). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the conclusion of any Evaluation Period, Acceptance or Final Acceptance will not relieve Contractor of its obligation to Resolve identified Nonconformities in accordance with this Agreement or as otherwise agreed to by the parties in the applicable Task Order.33

8.4.3.=[Bit/Sec_02]

8.4.4.Ti=Acceptance of Third Party Software and Equipment Provided by Contractor

8.4.4.sec=Unless otherwise expressly set forth in a Task Order, Third Party Software that is COTS and Third Party Equipment, in each case, included in Deliverables provided by Contractor, shall be Accepted in accordance with their applicable commercial terms and conditions. For avoidance of doubt, the hCentive Software will be tested and Accepted in accordance with Task Order No. 1.

8.4.5.Ti=Timing

8.4.5.sec=The Acceptance Process with respect to each Deliverable shall be performed within the Evaluation Period prescribed in the applicable Task Order; provided that in the case of any Deliverable for which no Evaluation Period is prescribed in the applicable Task Order, (i) Evaluation of any Deliverable shall be ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery, provided, however, that the parties may agree to extend the Evaluation Period for up to twenty (20) Business Days from the date of delivery for significant or complex Deliverables, and provided further that, unless otherwise expressly set forth in the applicable Task Order, the Evaluation Period for Final Acceptance shall be no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days including no less than ninety (90) days of Production Use of each of the Systems; and (ii) the fix/redelivery/re-performance period shall be ten (10) Business Days from the date of receipt of notice of rejection unless Client agrees in writing to a longer period. If at the end of any Evaluation Period or re-Evaluation Period, Client shall not have issued either an Acceptance or a notice of Nonconformities, the Deliverable will be deemed not Accepted. For the avoidance of doubt, Client's obligation to Accept and reject Deliverables in accordance with this Section 8.4 and the Task Orders shall be deemed a Client Responsibility and Client's failure to provide Acceptance or rejection in accordance with the stated Evaluation Periods or re-Evaluation Periods set forth above or as set forth in a Task Order shall be a Client Delay, shall result in an Excused Delay under Section 8.6(c) and shall form the basis for a request for a Change Order for Client Delays under Section 5.7(d).

8.4.6.Ti=Effect of Production Use

8.4.6.sec=The parties understand and agree that production use of any component of a Deliverable does not constitute Acceptance or Final Acceptance by Client.

8.4.=[Bit/Sec_06]

8.5.Ti=Final Acceptance

8.5.sec=After Contractor has delivered a completed System to Client for Evaluation, Client will follow the Acceptance Process described in Section 8.4 or each applicable Task Order to Evaluate a System as a whole when operating that System under full production conditions in accordance with the Acceptance Criteria also set forth in the relevant Task Order for that individual System. A System shall be Evaluated separately to determine compliance with applicable Acceptance Criteria for purposes of Final Acceptance. 

8.6.Ti=Responsibilities of the Parties; Delays

8.6.1.Ti=Client Responsibilities

8.6.1.sec=Client agrees that Contractor's performance under this Agreement is dependent on Client's timely and effective satisfaction of Client Responsibilities. Client further agrees to reasonably cooperate with Contractor in Contractor's performance of the Services. Accordingly, if Contractor believes34 that a delay by Client is materially impeding the performance of Contractor's obligations, Contractor shall timely inform Client, in writing, describing the nature and circumstances of such delay, including the date on which Contractor believes such delay by Client began. If Client determines, in its reasonable business judgment, that the applicable schedule under which a Client Responsibility is required is not reasonably feasible as a result of a failure by Contractor to meet the applicable Critical Milestone Date(s) or other delivery date(s) or timeline(s), then Contractor and Client shall use reasonable efforts to reschedule such Client Responsibility and Contractor shall reallocate, in good faith, its resources to minimize the impact of such Client Responsibility. Any dispute under this Section 8.6(a) shall be addressed in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 27. Notwithstanding that Client has agreed to perform the Client Responsibilities, Client's performance of such Client Responsibilities and Client's participation generally in the activities contemplated under this Agreement, shall not in any way relieve or diminish Contractor's responsibilities as the prime contractor, including its responsibilities for the performance of its Subcontractors, under this Agreement except to the extent such failure constitutes an Excused Delay.

8.6.2.Ti=Contractor Delays

8.6.2.sec=Contractor agrees to timely meet each Critical Milestone Date set forth in each Task Order. Contractor will meet all other dates set forth in each FP Task Order schedule, and will inform Client as promptly as reasonably possible regarding any anticipated delays.

8.6.3.Ti=Contractor Excused Delays

8.6.3.sec=In the event of an Excused Delay, Contractor shall continue performance as expeditiously as possible under the circumstances. Should the circumstance causing the Excused Delay cause an increase in the cost of performance, Contractor may submit a request for a Change Order pursuant to Section 5.7, including where applicable for Client Delays or Required Changes. Contractor shall not be responsible for failure to timely meet a Critical Milestone Date or other delivery date or timeline set forth in a Task Order (or breach to the extent resulting therefrom) due to an Excused Delay to the extent and for so long as such Excused Delay is the cause of such failure to meet the applicable date or timeline, provided that Contractor has notified Client's Project Director of the circumstances and the manner in which the cause of the Excused Delay is impacting Contractor's ability to perform as soon as reasonably possible after Contractor becomes aware of the cause of the Excused Delay. In addition, Contractor will also make a good faith effort to timely bring to Client's Project Director's attention any other circumstances of which it becomes aware that may cause an Excused Delay. 

8.6.=[Bit/Sec_03]

8.7.Ti=Liquidated Damages

8.7.sec=With respect to Task Orders, should a Contractor Delay occur, such Contractor Delay may result in costs that cannot accurately be estimated, and the parties agree that liquidated damages provisions may apply.

Client reserves the right to recall Client Assets at any time; provided, however, that if any such recall prevents Contractor from being able to provide the Services, then Contractor will continue to provide the Services to the extent reasonably possible, and the parties will agree to a Change Order. Any delay caused by such recall may be an Excused Delay unless such recall was a result of Contractor's failure to comply with Client's System Policies and Practices. Contractor shall not make any changes to any Client Assets without receiving express written permission from Client (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, the foregoing shall not limit Contractor's right to make changes to37 Client Owned Deliverables and Software and other materials that are Client Assets as reasonably required in order to perform the Services.

14.2.6.2.sec=(ii) If Contractor is the author or publisher of any COTS comprising any End User Software, or provides such COTS to Client as part of a solution to be provided pursuant to any Task Order (including, without limitation, the hCentive Software), Contractor must cure all failures identified by such testing prior to the delivery of such End User Software to Client except as otherwise set forth in the Mitigation Letter.

14.2.6.3.sec=(iii) If Contractor is neither the publisher of COTS comprising End User Software, and did not propose such Software to Client, Contractor is not responsible for the inherent accessibility defects of such Software. However, Contractor must, in addition to conducting the testing described in this Section 14.2, (1) adhere to the Software publisher's accessibility guidelines for configuration and (2) cooperate with the efforts of Client, the Accessibility Testing Vendor, and the Software publisher to create a solution or Workarounds for accessibility defects inherent in such Software but in no event shall Contractor be required to incur material additional costs in such efforts to cooperate.

14.2.6.4.sec=(iv) In accordance with the guidance set forth in the Mitigation Letter and working with the AAC, Contractor shall be responsible for curing all accessibility defects in End User Software as described in Section 14.2(f)(ii) and in End User Software that is developed under this Agreement. Contractor will address the most severe defects first as such defects have been prioritized working with the AAC and the Accessibility Testing Vendor. Curing of such defects may require, among other things, writing new source code, shutting off inaccessible features, providing users with third-party Software in addition to their assistive technology or providing disabled users with an alternative pathway to the inaccessible feature or the business process it automates.

14.2.6.5.sec=(v) Contractor shall collaborate with Client, the AAC, the Accessibility Testing Vendor and, where relevant, the Third Party Vendor of COTS, to50 resolve those accessibility defects in End User Software agreed to in the Mitigation Letter related to interoperability with the environments listed on the AT/IT List. The Mitigation Letter or other writing shall identify those defects that the AAC determines are so minor and superficial that they need not be addressed.

14.2.6.6.sec=(vi) Contractor shall not be responsible for curing accessibility defects in COTS that comprise End User Software that are Client Provided Third Party Software unless such COTS was proposed as part of the solution under a FP Task Order.

15.Ti=CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

15.1.Ti=Limits on Use

15.1.1.sec=(a) Confidential Information will remain the property of the disclosing party, and the receiving party will not be deemed by virtue of this Agreement or access to the disclosing party's Confidential Information to have acquired any right, title or interest in the Confidential Information. Confidential Information of the other party may be used by the receiving party and its Personnel and Subcontractors only in connection with performing its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement and may not be disclosed to any third party; in the case of Client Data, Contractor's access to, use of, or disclosure of Client Data shall, in all cases (including any use described in this Section 15), conform to the provisions of the Data Management and Confidentiality Agreement. Contractor will ensure that appropriate structural and organizational separation exists within the UHG Organization such that the UHC Organization and UHC Personnel will not have access to any Client Confidential Information.

15.1.2.sec=(b) Each party will protect the confidentiality of Confidential Information of the other party in the same manner that it protects the confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care, which efforts shall include, without limitation, entering into appropriate confidentiality agreements with Personnel and Subcontractors prior to disclosure of any Confidential Information that provide that such Personnel and Subcontractors maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information. Contractor will ensure that the Confidentiality Agreement for Contractor Personnel attached hereto as Exhibit G-2 is executed by all Personnel who (i) are performing Services at the Client's facilities, (ii) have access to Client's network or Client Confidential Information or (iii) are Core Project Team members. Access to Confidential Information will be restricted to those of Contractor's and Client's Personnel and Subcontractors engaged in a use permitted under this Agreement who have a need to know such information in connection with this Agreement (including without limitation, with respect to independent contractors working on a party's behalf in connection with this Agreement under written obligations of51 confidentiality at least as stringent as those set forth herein); however, Client may provide Advisers and IV&V Vendors with Contractor's Confidential Information provided that the Advisers have entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Contractor to protect the confidentiality of Contractor's Confidential Information on terms substantially similar to those set forth in this Section 15. In addition, if Contractor believes that any Adviser or IV&V Vendor is a competitor of Contractor, Contractor may require that the Adviser or IV&V Vendor enter into a non-disclosure agreement with Contractor to protect the confidentiality of Contractor's Confidential Information in the form set forth in Exhibit Q, however, if an Advisor or IV&V Vendor reasonably requests changes to such form, Contractor will not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay consent. Without limiting the foregoing, in no event will any UHC Personnel have access to any Client Confidential Information.

15.1.3.sec=(c) Confidential Information may not be copied or reproduced without the disclosing party's prior written consent, except as necessary for use in connection with this Agreement. Contractor shall not physically remove any hardcopy data of Client from the premises of Client without the prior approval of Client (in each case, such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, that Contractor may transmit electronic copies of Client Data to its servers, hard drives, and other storage locations as necessary to perform the Services. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing but subject to the terms of this Section 15, the receiving party, subject to its confidentiality obligations under this Agreement, may (i) retain copies of Confidential Information that it is required to retain by Law, (ii) retain copies of its work product that contain Confidential Information for archival purposes or to defend its work product and (iii) in accordance with legal, disaster recovery and records retention requirements, store such copies and derivative works in archival format (e.g., backup tapes), which may not be returned or destroyed upon request of Client.

15.1.4.sec=(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client's obligation to maintain Contractor's Confidential Information is subject and subordinate to Mass. Gen. Laws c. 4 sec. 7 cl. 26 and c. 66 sec. 10. The receiving party agrees to promptly notify the disclosing party of any unauthorized access, use or disclosure of the disclosing party's Confidential Information and to cooperate with and assist the disclosing party in every reasonable way to stop or minimize such unauthorized use, access or disclosure. Further, Contractor agrees to promptly notify Client if it learns of a breach of Contractor's security under M.G.L. c. 93H, which is the unauthorized acquisition or use of unencrypted Client Data that includes personal information that creates a substantial risk of identity theft or fraud. In addition to any rights Client may have under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement, Contractor shall indemnify Client for all costs incurred in providing any notices required by M.G.L. c. 93H in connection with such breach of security and other remediation measures provided to affected individuals.

15.4.Ti=Disclosure of the Other Party's Confidential Information

15.4.sec=In the event either party receives a subpoena, validly issued administrative or judicial process or public records request requesting that Confidential Information of the other party be disclosed, it will promptly notify the other party of such receipt. The party receiving such request will thereafter be entitled to comply with such subpoena or other process or request, only to the extent required by Law; provided that the Confidential Information so disclosed shall continue to be Confidential Information as between the parties hereto. The receiving party shall immediately notify the disclosing party's Project Director both orally and in writing if any information in the receiving party's possession is improperly used, copied or removed by anyone except an authorized representative of the disclosing party, or is requested by any federal or state agency or instrumentality other than Client. 
15.5.Ti=Equitable Relief

15.5.sec=The parties agree that disclosure of Client's or Contractor's Confidential Information by the other party, other than as permitted by this Section 15, will cause irreparable damage to Contractor or Client and therefore, in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity, each party shall have the right to seek equitable and injunctive relief, and to recover the amount of damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such unauthorized use. Each party shall be liable under this Agreement to the other party for any use or disclosure in violation of this Section 15 by such party, its Affiliates, Subcontractors or its or their respective Personnel, attorneys, accountants or other advisors.

The parties' intent is that these work activities be regarded as independent and separate engagements but are grouped together only to accommodate the emergency procurement process. The limitations of liability in Section 20.1(b) below are segregated by work activities on the following basis: (i) Task Orders 1 and 2 consist of development, configuration and customization services, a large of portion which is under a Fixed Price arrangement; (ii) Task Order 3 consists of ongoing hosting and managed services on a per-member per month (PMPM) fee arrangement; and (iii) Task Orders 4, 5, 6 and 7 consist of T&M services that have been mostly already performed and were undertaken by Contractor at risk prior to the execution of this Agreement. The parties agree that there is nothing precedential about the limitation of liability set forth in Section 20.1(b).

"Other damages" shall not include damages to the Commonwealth as a result of third party claims; provided, however, that the foregoing in no way limits the Commonwealth's right of recovery for personal injury or property damages or patent and copyright infringement under Section 11 of the Commonwealth Terms nor the Commonwealth's ability to join Contractor as a third party defendant. Further, the term "other damages" shall not include, and in no event shall Contractor be liable for, damages for the Commonwealth's use of Contractor-59 provided products or services, loss of Commonwealth records, or data (or other intangible property), loss of use of equipment, lost revenue, lost savings or lost profits of the Commonwealth. In no event shall "other damages" exceed the greater of (a) with respect to any claim arising under either of Task Order 1 or 2, two times the aggregate Fees under Task Orders 1 and 2; (b) with respect to any claim arising under Task Order 3, two times the aggregate Fees under Task Order 3; or (c) with respect to any claim arising under any of Task Orders 4, 5, 6 or 7, two times the aggregate Fees under all of such Task Orders 4, 5, 6 or 7.. This Section 20 and Section 11 of the Commonwealth Terms, together with the Standard Contract Form, set forth the Contractor's entire liability under this Agreement.

20.3.1.1.sec=(i) $1,000,000 per occurrence/general aggregate commercial general liability;

20.3.1.2.sec=(ii) $5,000,000 per occurrence errors and omissions (professional liability); and 

20.3.1.3.sec=(iii) statutory limits for workers' compensation.

20.3.1.=[Bit/Ssec_03]

20.3.2.sec=(b) If requested by Client, Contractor shall furnish certificates of insurance, and insurance shall be with carriers that may lawfully issue such insurance policies, have an AM Best rating of at least A-VII or a Standard and Poor's rating of at least AA unless a prior written approval is obtained from Client (in each case, such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

27.1.sec=Except as otherwise provided by this Section 27.1, in the event of any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement, the parties agree to work together in good faith to resolve the dispute internally by escalating it to the Project Managers immediately after the dispute arises. In the event that the Project Managers are unable to resolve the dispute within five (5) Business Days after it is brought to their attention, the dispute should be escalated to the Joint Project Committee. In the event that the Joint Project Committee is unable to resolve the dispute within ten (10) Business Days after the dispute arises, and in an effort to otherwise resolve any conflict that arises during the course of this Agreement or following completion of this Agreement, Client and Contractor may, but shall not be required to, agree that such dispute (subject to the written approval of the Commonwealth's Office of the Attorney General) shall be submitted to nonbinding mediation through the Massachusetts Office of Dispute Resolution. The parties shall take such steps as reasonably necessary to mitigate any damages that each party may accrue during the escalation and mediation procedures.

27.2.Ti=Rights and Remedies

27.2.sec=Both parties have entered into this Agreement with the understanding that the Services are critical to Client's operations. Consequently, both parties shall seek to perform their duties in a timely and efficient manner in accordance with all of the terms of this Agreement to allow timely and successful performance of the Services in accordance with each applicable Project Plan for each System. Each party shall have the rights and remedies set forth in this Agreement including those rights set forth in Section 21.2 and at law, equity and statute to address performance and performance related issues including those related to the delivery of the Services, Deliverables, and warranty, maintenance or support services. Specific remedies set forth in this Agreement for specific failures shall be cumulative and shall not be exclusive of other rights or remedies available to the party alleging breach whether such other remedies are provided at law, equity or statute. For purposes of clarity, assessment of liquidated damages and Holdback retention in accordance with Section 8.7 and Section 12.6 shall be without prejudice to any rights or remedies that Client or Contractor may have under this Agreement, at law or in equity. In the event that Client elects to seek actual damages related to the same events for which liquidated damages were assessed and paid or credited under Section 8.7, Holdback Amounts were retained under Section 12.6 and/or Service Level (as defined in Exhibit B-3, Task Order 3) credits were assessed under any applicable Task Order, any damages award in connection therewith shall be reduced by the amount of such liquidated damages, Holdback Amounts and/or Service Level credits.
