Intro={P1.I/We} am pleased that you have asked {P1.Name.Full} ("{P1.Handle}," {P1.I/we-me/us}) to serve as your legal counsel, and {P1.I/we} look forward to working with you.  At the outset of the engagement, it is appropriate to confirm our understanding regarding your engagement of {P1.Handle}, and to describe the basis on which {P1.Handle} will be agreeing to provide legal services.  Accordingly, {P1.I/we} submit for your approval the following provisions governing the engagement.  If you are in agreement, please sign the letter in the space provided below.  If you have any questions about these provisions, or if you would like to discuss possible modifications, please call {P1.me/us}.

Scope-of-Attorney-Client-Relationship=<b>Scope of Attorney-Client Relationship</b><br>{Scope.WhoIsClient}<br>{Scope.PatentProsecution}<br>{Scope.Additional}<br>{Scope.Limit}

Scope.WhoIsClient={P1.Handle}'s client in this matter will be {P2.Name.Full} ("you" or "your").  

Scope.PatentProsecution={P1.Handle} will be engaged to represent you in connection with the preparation and filing of a non-provisional utility patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and of an international patent application filed in accordance with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT).  These applications will be directed to {Patent.IncomingSituation}.

Patent.IncomingSituation (Note)=DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION AND WHETHER THERE'S A PROVISIONAL ON FILE

Scope.Additional={P1.I/We} would be happy to discuss with you  {P1.my/our}  engagement for additional purposes; any such engagement may be subject to a separate letter.  {P1.I/We} will work on those particular tasks that you ask {P1.me/us} to do in connection with this matter.  

Scope.Limit= {P1.I am/We are}  not acting as your counsel generally, and  {P1.I am/we are}  not responsible for other legal matters that may affect you.  For instance,  {P1.I am/we are}  not providing you with written legal opinions regarding infringement or non-infringement of any specific patent property.  Nor {P1.am I/are we} providing you with any patentability search results, per your instructions.   {P1.I am/We are}  not representing you in connection with securities disclosures, in any tax proceedings, or in other regulatory or administrative matters.  You are not relying on {P1.me/us} for, and  {P1.I am/we are}  not providing, any business investment or accounting advice, or any investigation into the character or credit of persons with whom you might be dealing.  Any expression on  {P1.my/our}  part concerning the outcome of your legal matter is an expression of  {P1.my/our}  professional judgment and is not the guarantee of a result.


Client-Rights-and-Responsibilities=<b>Client Rights and Responsibilities</b><br>{Client.Communicate}<br>{Client.Facts}<br>{Client.OwnInvention}<br>{Client.Reads}<br>{Client.Address}


Client.Communicate=The attorney-client relationship is founded upon mutual trust and confidence.  {P1.I/We} encourage you to share with {P1.me/us} your expectations and any concerns regarding  {P1.my/our}  services at all times during the course of the engagement.  {P1.I/We} will keep you informed of developments regarding your matters and will consult with you as necessary to ensure the timely, effective and efficient completion of the work.  If you are at any time dissatisfied with the service you are receiving or would like to discuss with {P1.me/us}  how  {P1.my/our}  service to you could be improved, please do not hesitate to contact {P1.me/us}.

Client.Facts=In order for {P1.me/us} to assist you effectively and efficiently, {P1.I/We} expect that you will provide {P1.me/us} with the factual information you have which relates to the subject matter of this engagement, and that you will make any appropriate business or technical decisions.  {P1.I/We} believe that you should be actively involved in the strategy and management of your legal affairs, and  {P1.my/our}  goal is to encourage candid and frequent communication between us.  You have agreed to keep {P1.me/us}  informed of all developments relating to this matter, provide documents and other information in a timely manner, and attend required meetings.

Client.OwnInvention=By signing this letter you confirm that you (and any relevant employees) are not currently under any duties to assign this invention(s) to third parties or under any duties not to compete with any third parties.

Client.Reads=In the course of this engagement, you may be asked to read and perhaps to sign various legal documents.  Please read the documents carefully so that you thoroughly understand them.  If you have any question whatsoever, you should address it with {P1.me/us}  right away.

Client.Address=It is also important that {P1.I/We} maintain a current address for you at all times.  Please notify {P1.me/us} promptly of any address change.  Even following the completion of the requested services, there may be a need to contact you in order to help maintain your rights.  In that event, a mailing sent to the last address of which you have informed {P1.me/us}  (which may be an e-mail address) would be considered adequate notice. 


Confidentiality=<b>Confidentiality</b><br>In the course of the engagement, {P1.Handle} cannot furnish you with any non-public information about other clients of the law firm, and {P1.I/we} will not furnish your non-public information to others.


Fees-Invoices-Office-Closures-and-Records=<b>Standard Terms of Engagement - Fees, Invoices, Office Closures, and Records</b><ol><li>{Term.Fee}</li><li>{Invoices-and-Statements}</li><li>{OfficeClosure}</li><li>{Records}</li></ol>


Term.Fee=<u>Fees for Legal Services</u><br>{P1.Handle}'s charges for services rendered in connection with this engagement are based upon a flat-fee {rate} of {Flat-Fee-Total}.  These charges are based upon two flat-fee{_rates}:<ol><li>{Fee.USPTO}</li><li>{Fee.PCT}</li><li>{Fee.Filing}</li></ol>{Fee.Stop}<br>{Fee.AdditionalInventions}<br>{Patent-Search-Limitations}<br>{Fee.Shared}<br>{Fee.NotContingent}
rate=<b></b>
_rates=<b></b>
Fee.USPTO={Fee.USPTO.Application} {Fee.USPTO.Review} {Fee.USPTO.Reporting}

Fee.USPTO.Application=The fee for preparing and filing the US non-provisional application is a flat fee of {Flat-Fee-USPTO}, which includes up to $1,600 of filing fees charged by the US Patent and Trademark Office for applications with up to twenty claims total, three independent claims, and 100 sheets in length.

Note=Review!
FeeUSPTO.Search=A search is included in this rate. 

Fee.USPTO.Reporting=This fee also includes the cost of reporting to you the receipt of filing-confirmation and publication correspondence from the Patent Office after the filing date, as well as the preparation and recordation of assignment and/or power of attorney documentation after the filing of the US patent application.

Fee.PCT=The fee for preparing and filing the PCT application is a flat fee of {Flat-Fee-PCT}.  This fee includes up to $3,500 in standard filing fees charged by the International Bureau (via the USPTO as its receiving office and designating the Korean Patent Office as the Searching Authority), as well as the cost of reporting to you the receipt of filing-related documentation from the various international agencies with explanations of each piece of correspondence.

Fee.Filing=Please note that any filing fees required by any of the patent offices for additional claims or sheets will be charged to you in addition to the flat fee.  Additionally, should you request that we file using Searching Authority other than Korea, the extra fees will be charged to you in addition to the flat fee.  In the event that none of the inventors are US citizens and we are required to work with legal counsel in other countries to complete the international filing, additional fees will apply.


Fee.Stop=Please note that should you instruct {P1.me/us}  to stop working on the matter after {P1.I/We} have begun work on this matter, {P1.I/We} will charge you a total of {Fee-Stop-Early.$}.  Should you instruct {P1.me/us}  to stop working on the matter after the claims have been drafted, {P1.I/We} will charge you a total of {Fee-Stop-Midway.$}.

Fee.AdditionalInventions=Please note that this fee is for the invention(s) we have discussed in our recent conversations.  Should you wish to add a description and/or claims relating to additional inventions, there may be an additional fee.  In some cases, it will be more appropriate to file such additional inventions in separate patent applications, which would be subject to a new engagement letter.  In other cases, {P1.I/We} will work with you to identify an appropriate additional fee, which may be as much as the current flat fee.

Patent-Search-Limitations=IF DOING A SEARCH, ADD A PARAGRAPH NOTING THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS AND RISKS OF PATENTABILITY SEARCHES

Fee.Shared={Fee.Shared.Possible} {Fee.Shared.SpecifiedContractors} {Fee.Shared.Procedure}
Fee.Shared.SpecifiedContractors={Fee.Shared.SpecifiedContractors }
Fee.Shared.Possible=In some instances, a portion of these fees may be shared with attorneys, search firms, paralegals, or other contractors that are not members of {P1.Handle}.  For example, {P1.I/we} may work with an independent contractor who can draft initial versions of an application, prepare filing-related documentation, make revisions to a draft application, or proofread final versions of the application.
 
Fee.Shared.Procedure={P1.I/We} will inform you by email before using any contractor not named here.  Any such outside contractors sign confidentiality agreements explicitly stating that they will not disclose any client confidential information to others and {P1.I/We} will inform you of their involvement before they begin work.  {P1.Handle} will maintain responsibility for the work done and strive to make the use of such contractors {invisible to/seamless for} you.  Furthermore, the use of these contractors does not impact how much you are paying for the application.

invisible to/seamless for=seamless for
  
Fee.NotContingent=These fees are not contingent upon a particular outcome or the closing of a transaction.  You agree that responsibility for payment is solely yours.  Any outside arrangements you may have for reimbursement, insurance, indemnification or the like will not change your obligation.

Invoices-and-Statements=<u>Invoices and Statements</u><br>{InitialPayment}<br>{SecondPayment}


InitialPayment=It is  {P1.my/our}  standard practice that the representation shall commence upon  {P1.my/our}  receipt of an initial advance of {Fee-Advance.$}.  This portion of the fee is earned upon receipt, which means that {P1.I/We} do not hold it in trust to bill against it later.  You will receive periodic account statements noting as {P1.I/We} complete the work covered by the earned upon receipt fee.  The flat fee covers the legal services, documents, telephone calls and emails necessary to complete the representation, and any costs and expenses specified in section 4.1 above.  Note that even though the fee is earned upon receipt, you always retain the right to terminate {P1.Handle} at any time and may be entitled to a refund of a portion of the fee, based on work completed and as agreed in section {D.a.} above.  

SecondPayment={P1.I/We} will earn the remaining amount of the fee upon filing the patent application and will invoice you at that point.  {P1.Handle} expects to receive payment for its services no later than 15 days from the invoice date.  Please do not hesitate to contact {P1.me/us}  with any questions regarding your invoice.
Note=ONLY IF ANY SUBSTANTIVE UPCOMING TIME RESTRICTION
OfficeClosure=<u>Office Closures</u><br>Please note our office will be closed on the following dates.  If this poses any concerns for you, please let {P1.me/us}  know before returning this letter.

Records=<u>Client Records</u><br>After this engagement has ended, you may request the return of files pertaining to the work performed for you.  It is  {P1.my/our}  practice to retain the permanent records of the matter, in accordance with  {P1.my/our}  records retention policy, for a period of not less than 7 years after the matter with you has ended.  If you do not request the files in writing before the end of the retention period, upon the expiration of that period {P1.I/We} will have no further obligation to retain the files and may at  {P1.my/our}  discretion destroy the files without further notice to you.

Mutual-Right-to-Terminate-Engagement=<b>Mutual Right to Terminate Engagement</b><br>You may terminate {P1.Handle}'s engagement at any time by notifying me.  Likewise, {P1.Handle} may withdraw from this representation by written notice any time for any reason - including, e.g., by reason of your failure to pay fees or expenses - provided withdrawal is permitted or required under applicable rules of professional conduct.  Notwithstanding any such notice, you will remain responsible for payment of any outstanding statements and accrued fees and expenses incurred before termination, or incurred thereafter in connection with an orderly transition of the matter.

Use-of-Email=<b>Use of Email</b><br>{Email.Use}<br>{Email.ClientAddress}

Email.Use= {P1.I am/We are}  accustomed to using email as a quick and effective means for communicating with clients.  However, you should understand that no medium of communication is 100% secure.  While {P1.I/We} have no reason to suppose that  {P1.my/our}  email system is not reasonably secure, there is a risk that email exchanged between us may be intercepted, may be diverted, and/or for technical reasons may never reach its addressees.  It may be appropriate to use alternative media to communicate particularly sensitive material and to seek confirmation in other situations that an electronic message has been received.  Moreover, although {P1.I/we} have implemented measures to protect against sending or receiving computer viruses and other malicious programs, {P1.I/we} cannot guarantee that these will be completely effective.  Should you wish to implement any cryptographic solutions for either email or file sharing, please let {P1.me/us}  know as soon as possible.

Email.ClientAddress=You are responsible for providing {P1.me/us}  with an email address that you want {P1.me/us}  to use for correspondence related to the representation.  You should check that email address regularly.  However, you should not use third-party email addresses or computers, nor should you use public computers or Internet access (such as at a public library, cafe or hotel) to communicate with me, in order to protect the confidentiality of our discussions.  {P1.I/We} will assume that third parties do not have access to that email address and, therefore, that you can receive confidential correspondence from {P1.me/us}  at that address.  {P1.I/We} will also assume that you are receiving and reviewing  {P1.my/our}  emails at that address unless you alert {P1.me/us}  to an issue.  Please be certain that your email filters do not block emails from  {P1.my/our}  office and that the allowable size of incoming emails is sufficient to accept emails from {P1.me/us}  with attachments.  It is important that you retain all correspondence from and to me, including emails and attachments you send to me.  These will be your files for this matter.  You are responsible for maintaining your own copy of the file.

Approval-and-Return-of-Signature=<b>Approval and Return of Signature</b><br>{P1.I/We} view it as a privilege to represent  {P1.my/our}  clients, and {P1.I/We} thank you again for the opportunity to represent you in this matter.<br>In order to confirm that you agree to the terms of engagement stated in this letter, please sign a copy of this letter in the space below and return the signed copy to {P1.me/us}  at your earliest convenience.  If you do not reply to the letter but provide {P1.me/us}  with the requested advance, it will be deemed that you have agreed to the terms stated in this letter.  If you do not reply to the letter or provide {P1.me/us}  with the requested advance within {client-time-to-respond} of {DOC.Sign.YMD}, it will be deemed that you have elected not to engage {P1.me/us}  at this time.  If you have questions at any time during the course of this engagement, please do not hesitate to contact me.  {P1.I/We} look forward to working with you.

Sincerely=Sincerely,<br><br>{P1.Name.Full}<br>{P1.xSignature}<br><br><br><br>Acceptance of Terms of Engagement<br><br>I have read the above letter and agree to its terms, effective as of the date on which {P1.Handle} first provided services to the company in this matter.<br><br>{P2.Sign.Block}
