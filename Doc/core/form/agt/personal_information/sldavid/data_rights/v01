0.0=This Standard Data Rights Distributed Management Services Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is effective as to any {Party} on the date of {Acceptance}of the {Online Registration} of any such Party (the "Effective Date&rdquo;)(such party a "Registered Party&rdquo;).
0.1.Title=Registered Party Rights and Obligations:
0.1.1=From and after the Effective Date, and until the {Termination Date}, any Registered Party in {Good Standing} under this Agreement shall enjoy the rights of a "Data Rights Owner,&rdquo; and be subject to the obligations and affirmative duties of a "Data User&rdquo; as the context requires, all as provided herein.&nbsp;
0.1.2=Hence, each Registered Party hereunder will have the status of a "Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and "Data User&rdquo; under this Agreement, but its rights and duties recognized under this Agreement will vary, as required, from those associated with one or the other status depending upon their roles in a particular {Data Action Event.}.&nbsp;References to "Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and "Data User&rdquo; hereunder are intended to convey such status differences as the context requires, and both terms are used alternately with references to "Registered Party&rdquo; as the context requires.
0.1=<u>{0.1.Title}</u><br>{0.1.1}<br>{0.1.2}
0.2.Title=Registered Party in Its Role as Data Rights Owner Enjoys Distributed Data Rights Management Services:
0.2.1=The satisfactory performance by Registered Parties of their various duties under this Agreement in their capacity as Data Users, and their accountability therefor through mechanisms of enforcement under this Agreement (or cross referenced in the schedules hereof), {makes real}{gives effect to} the rights of Data Rights Owners under this Agreement, and carries into effect the system of distributed Data Rights Management "Services&rdquo; (including the sub-categories of Services set forth in Section 3 hereof).
0.2.2=These Services are, in turn, enjoyed by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners in consideration of their provisional and conditional granting of various specific data rights under this Agreement to other Registered Parties acting as Data Users hereunder in order to secure such satisfactory performance.&nbsp;
0.2.3=The rights and duties hereunder are mutually dependent and are enforceable pursuant to this standard form contract, and each Registered Party is therefore {expected}{understood} to assume alternating roles under this Agreement. &nbsp;This Agreement documents an integrated and distributed network of dependencies in which it is in every Registered Party&rsquo;s self interest to perform the duties under the Agreement (in its capacity as both a Data User, and also those duties assigned to Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners) as an integrated legal structure designed to help auto-catalyze otherwise-unattainable security and leverage benefits for Registered Parties acting both as Data Rights Owners and as Data Users under this Agreement.&nbsp;
0.2=<u>{0.2.Title}</u><br>{0.2.1}<br>{0.2.2}<br>{0.2.3}
0.3.Title=Registered Party in the Role of Data User Enjoys Data Access, Cost Reduction and Risk/Liability Mitigation:
0.3.1=Not only does the satisfactory performance by a Registered Party of its various duties under this Agreement in its role as Data User qualify such Registered User for the protection of their rights as a Data Rights Owner hereunder; it also qualifies such Data User for the rights and benefits provided to Data Users under this Agreement.
0.3.2=Data User rights include, without limitation, (i) enhanced, co-managed access to higher quality Circulating Data and Vault Data under the terms hereof, (ii) various contractual "safe harbors&rdquo; described herein, (iii) the benefits of conditional covenants by Registered Parties not to sue other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Users with respect to objectively-testable, Agreement-conformant behavior, and (iv) other standards that can help to reduce the risk and cost to Data Users of interacting with data, and enhance access to valuable Circulating and Vault Data for Registered Parties as Data Users (consistent with and in furtherance of Data Rights Owners enforceable interests), all as provided further in this Agreement.
0.3=<u>{0.3.Title}</u><br>{0.3.1}<br>{0.3.2}
0.4.Title=Registered Parties are All Mutually Bound:
0.4.1=Upon Registration Acceptance (which follows the act of Registration for Registered Party {Applications} that meet {Acceptance Criteria}, which includes an affirmative agreement to the terms of this Agreement) each Registered Party is bound to all other Registered Parties to this Agreement, and hence into direct contractual "privity&rdquo; with every other Registered Party.&nbsp; There are no third party beneficiary rights under the Agreement, which means that only Registered Parties can enjoy the contract rights under this Agreement, and only Registered Parties are bound to its terms.&nbsp;
0.4.2=To enjoy such rights, a party must agree to be bound to the duties of a Data User {and also the duties of a Data Rights Owner} hereunder, knowing that any and all Registered Parties in the entire population of Registered Parties can enforce this Agreement against any other Registered Party, including them, under the terms of this Agreement and as otherwise provided by applicable law.
0.4.3=Thus, when a party becomes a Registered Party, it owes duties under this Agreement to take actions relating to Vault Data and Circulating Data pursuant to described duties-of-care which conform to the obligations and responsibilities of a "Data User&rdquo; hereunder, and they simultaneously become a beneficiary of the conformant performance by other Registered Parties to those standards-of-care.&nbsp; The conformant performance of such duties gives life to the legal rights of Data Rights Owner hereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The use of a standard form agreement (such as this Agreement) across the entire population of Registered Parties assures that the rights and duties will extend to both bind and benefit all other Registered Parties, even those that a particular Registered Party will never meet in person.)
0.4.4=In the distributed legal architecture of this Agreement, the standardized, auditable, accountable, enforceable rights and duties connect each Registered Party to every other Registered Party, and create behavioral reliability that is the precursor to formalized, scalable "trust&rdquo; among all Registered Parties and every other Registered Party.&nbsp; The system&rsquo;s reliability is built upon the distributed sources of a form of "neighborhood watch&rdquo; constructed from the natural attentiveness of the stakeholders (borne of self-interest) regarding their respective rights under this Agreement (whether such rights are characterized as related to fundamental, civil, contractual, statutory, regulatory, or other rights in a given jurisdiction) and their ability to exercise private rights of action under this Agreement to enforce those rights.&nbsp;
0.4=<u>{0.4.Title}</u><br>{0.4.1}<br>{0.4.2}<br>{0.4.3}<br>{0.4.4}
0.5.Title=Supplemental Rights Permitted:
0.5.1=The various rights that are fostered by this Agreement, and are manifested in the Services under section 3, are each intended to deliver real benefit to realize the Data Rights Owners&rsquo; interests in the two general categories of "data security/privacy&rdquo; and "data leverage.&rdquo; &nbsp;The performance of the bundle of Data User duties by Registered Parties under this Agreement in their respective capacities as Data Users is enjoyed by Data Rights Owners as distributed Data Rights Management Services.
0.5.2=All Registered Parties will be equally bound to the obligations and duties set forth in this Agreement, provided that any sub-group of Registered Owners may agree to additional rights and duties that apply only to such sub-group, so long as they are not inconsistent with {(and promote)} those provided under this Agreement.
0.5.2=Thus, for example, commercial, governmental or civil society entities that institutionalize the provision of some or all of such "Supplemental Services&rdquo; hereunder in their role as {Data User Intermediaries}, may offer various additional incentives, such as monetary payments and service enhancements, to attract Registered Parties to a particular set of Supplemental Services.&nbsp; In such a case, both Registered Parties will be aware that such Supplemental Services are required to be provided in a manner that is consistent with the Services hereunder, which Services are more broadly recognized beyond any such sub-group of Registered Parties to which such Supplemental Services apply, and which Services reflect the population-cohering behavioral artifact of a basic distributed legal infrastructure, documented in this Agreement, to support the distributed data architecture of the Internet.
0.5=<u>{0.5.Title}</u><br>{0.5.1}<br>{0.5.2}
0.6=For and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Registered Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby contract and agree as follows:
0={0.0}<br>{0.1}<br>{0.2}<br>{0.3}<br>{0.4}<br>{0.5}<br>{0.6}

1.Title=Background and Purpose; Agreement Standardizes a Set of Data Usage Duties and Supplements Other Agreements
1.1=This Agreement documents a set of mutually-dependent agreements associated with data-related exchanges and interactions between and among multiple Registered Parties, including both individuals and institutions, each of which is called a "Registered Party&rdquo; and each of which alternately acts as a &quot;Data Rights Owner&quot; and {&quot;Data User&quot;}{"Data Handler&rdquo;} (both as defined below), sometimes in both roles even within a related series of interactions..
1.2=The "dual role&rdquo; of every Registered Party provides the incentive, balanced with obligation, that is a stabilizing influence in this data infrastructure for other economic/legal/social architectures upon which co-managed data rights management depends.&nbsp; Under this Agreement structure, to reduce one&rsquo;s own risk, a Registered Party must act in a way to help other Registered Parties to reduce their respective risks.&nbsp; The opportunity of a Party to enjoy the rights provided under this Agreement is conditioned upon their performance of duties under this Agreement.&nbsp; The interdependence of these contractual rights and duties in this document is intended to reflect and make reliable and enforceable their functional mutual interdependence so that data system reliability can be established as a foundation for online "trust.&rdquo;
1.3=The Agreement structure seeks to create and deploy a distributed legal architecture to serve the needs of stakeholders engaging in data exchanges across data networks that depend upon a distributed data architecture, such as the Internet.&nbsp; Accordingly, under this Agreement, each Registered Party in its role as Data User shall, in consideration for enjoying its rights as Data User as set forth herein, abide by certain conditions and requirements associated with its access to such data ("Data User Duties&rdquo;).
1.4=Every Registered Party&rsquo;s&rsquo; fulfillment of its promise to perform the duties assigned to it under this Agreement constitutes the successful "recruitment&rdquo; of Registered Parties as Data Users to help achieve Registered Party&rsquo;s goals to enjoy rights (such as "privacy&rdquo; and other data integrity rights) as Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; The performance of these standard duties by populations of Registered Parties/Data Users achieves risk and cost reduction at large scale for all Registered Parties, in ways that they cannot achieve unilaterally (and cannot even achieve among existing online data/identity standards consortia), and more effectively provides Data Rights Owner and Data Rights Owner&#39;s Affiliates (if that option is selected by Data Rights Owner) with functional, enforceable, accountable, "crowd sourced,&rdquo; data rights management services (and related identity information-technology services) received from any party that comes into possession of Vault Data and Circulating Data in which Data Rights Owner has an interest, all on the terms and conditions set forth below.
1.5=To the extent that either the Data Rights Owner or Data User are, at any time while they are a party to this Agreement, parties to a separate legal agreement (or other legal obligation) through which Data User collects, stores, handles, uses, transfers, processes {other verbs here to cover standard set of "Data Actions?&rdquo;} or otherwise has possession or access to data from, relating to or relatable to Data Rights Owner in accordance with that agreement and applicable local law or pursuant to which data about Data Rights Owner is shared with third-parties (whether such sharing is done on behalf of Data Rights Owner or Data User), as the case may be (each an "Existing Agreement&rdquo;), the Registered Parties that are also the Parties thereto wish to continue to be bound by such Existing Agreements to define their legal relationships external to those set forth in this Agreement, and to supplement such Existing Agreements with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Parties mutually acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement are supplemental to those of the Existing Agreement(s), and to the extent of any conflict between the terms of such agreements, the terms of this Agreement replace and supersede the terms and conditions of the Existing Agreements.

4.0.1.3=Vault Data Sharing Services
4.0.1.4=Data Portability Services
4.0.1.5=Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services
4.0.1.6=Other Services made available by Data User to Data Rights owner from time to time.
4.0.1=ESLs may be established for one or more of the following categories of services:
4.0.2=ESLs are not anticipated to be established for Circulating Data Leverage Services, since the Data User activities that are associated with such Services are performed by Data User on its own behalf, not on behalf of a Data Rights Owner (notwithstanding the Data User&rsquo;s obligation to account to Data Rights Owner for revenues generated through its Circulating Data Leverage Services activities).
4.0.3=ESLs are established for the express purpose of creating a threshold of performance for some aspect of the relevant Service for which the ESL is provided.&nbsp; In the event that Data User fails to provide and perform the relevant Service at a level that is equivalent to that called for in a particular ESL, Data Rights Owner can pursue remedies through the Fee Reduction Mechanism provided for in section __ of this Agreement, and other remedies provided for herein.
4.0.4=ESLs are not intended to provide comprehensive "specifications&rdquo; for duties-of-care associated with performance of Services by Data Users; this entire Agreement and the Schedules set forth a more comprehensive set of requirements associated with Data User performance hereunder.
4.0.5=Instead, the ESLs are only intended to identify those Service elements for which (i) performance is sufficiently empirically and objectively measurable, and (ii) for which the damages due to harm is the most directly calculable, that ESL performance failures can lend themselves to contractual liquidated damages structures that can be deployed effectively by automated, scalable dispute resolution systems, such as those that support this Agreement.
4.0.6=Thus, only a subset of the rights of Data Rights Owners will lend themselves to treatment under the ESL arrangements of this section 4.&nbsp; It is, however, anticipated that the proportion of Services that lend themselves to ESL treatment will increase over time, as candidate "best practices&rdquo; for emerging Data User standards of care are shared, and rules and expected Vault Data and Circulating Data behaviors are normalized and harmonized across jurisdictions and sectors.&nbsp; Any such ESL-market advancement will be documented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

4.2.1=Data User shall make available to Data Rights Owners reports and statistics regarding its performance of the various Services with respect to any Vault Data and Circulating Data for any other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners against the ESLs during each calendar month, by the fifteenth (15th) business day of the following month.
4.2.2=Measurements of system availability that are included in the reports under this Agreement shall exclude (i) scheduled downtime, (ii) delays in the provision of a Service schedule requested by or caused by Data Rights Owner, and (iii) unscheduled downtime to the extent attributable to (x) Force Majeure Events, or (y) the acts or omissions of Data Rights Owner or its employees, agents, third-party contractors, and suppliers.

Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Users hereunder{, that generate revenue from the use Vault Data and Circulating Data,} shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in their respective sectors, jurisdictions and contexts (and subject to applicable law), to improve their performance of the Services, both in relation to the ESLs and otherwise, throughout the Term, whether through the adoption and use of more efficient technologies, more effective network architectures, better integrated technical and legal interoperability advances, and the like.
4.3=<u>{4.3.Title}</u><br>{4.3.0}
4.4.Title=Limited Suspension of ESLs to Accommodate Data Rights Owner
4.4.0=If and to the extent that Data User fails to meet a specific ESL as a result of material actions, errors, or omissions of Data Rights Owner, such ESL will be deemed to be suspended for an amount of time as is reasonably necessary for Data User to again achieve conformity to such ESL.&nbsp; Data User may take such reasonable precautions as it deems necessary to prevent the recurrence of any such event.

Examples (by way of illustration and not exclusion) of the CESLS that may be requested by the Data Rights Owner are increased and additional requirements relating to any one or more of the Services and any other additional obligation or duty relating to the collection, storage, use, transmission and handling of Vault Data and Shared Vault Data by Data User.
5.3.0.2=A Registered Party acting as a Data User shall be required to use in connection with its provision of services under a CESLS, and cause its suppliers to use, the third party services, networks, applications and other functionality offered by such other parties as it agrees to provide to Data Rights Owner pursuant to such CESLS.
5.3.0.3=Each Data Rights Owner agrees and acknowledges that CESLSs entered into between a particular Registered Party acting as a Data User and other Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners are only binding on such Data User with respect to the Data Rights Owner(s) that are explicitly covered under each such CESLS, and that such Data User&rsquo;s duties and obligations under any one or more CESLSs do not establish an "industry practice&rdquo; or "standard of care&rdquo; that affects the rights of any such other Data Rights Owners, or the Services provided by any Data User to such Data Rights Owners, or any ESL that is not a CESLS, provided that any Data User may agree to adopt and abide by any CESLS of another Data User (either through normative cross reference, or by inclusion of "mirror&rdquo; CESLS terms directly in its arrangements with Data Rights Owners with which it interacts.&nbsp;
5.3.0.4=Registered Party in its capacity as Data Rights Owner also acknowledges and agrees that Data User may, in its sole and exclusive discretion, choose to offer any part or all of the services under any CESLS to one or more other Data Rights Owners, and others, and may establish new Services that offer such services, except as the Data Rights Owner and such Data User have previously agreed, and that Data Rights Owner shall have no right in any such new services, and shall receive no compensation therefore, except to the extent otherwise explicitly set forth in a CESLS, or other law or agreement applicable to the parties and to a particular CESLS in to which they have entered.
5.3.0.5.1=A Data Rights Owner that has entered a CESLS with Data User will reasonably cooperate with Data User in causing any third party services identified by Data Rights Owner to be made interoperable with the Services. 
5.3.0.5.2=Subject to the applicable CESLS, Data Rights Owner will reimburse and hold Data User harmless from and against all costs paid by Data User with respect to third party charges incurred on Data Rights Owner&#39;s behalf, and at Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s request, in Data User&rsquo;s fulfillment of such CESLS.
5.3.0.5={5.3.0.5.1}  {5.3.0.5.2}
5.3.0.6=A Data User may use and apply any such third party connection or arrangement that was originally established for one Data Rights Owner to also interoperate with any other Data Rights Owner without the prior written consent of Data Rights Owner, provided however, that it shall provide notice of such use to the Data Rights Owner with which it entered the CESLS covering such connection, and shall reduce or eliminate any future payments required to be paid by such Data Rights Owner to reflect the equitable sharing of such expenses across the group of Data Rights Owners for which the connection or arrangement offers an advantage.

8.12.Title=Fee Reductions
8.12.1=This Section 8.12 (and Schedule 8.12) specify certain &quot;Fee Reductions.&quot;&nbsp; It is understood that these Fee Reductions are intended to reflect, to some extent, the diminished value of Data User&#39;s Services in certain limited and identified events where system performance does not conform to a relevant ESL.&nbsp; Fee Reductions are intended to incentivize consistent performance by Registered Parties acting as Data Users and to provide an efficient and satisfactory method of compensatory recovery for Data Rights Owners that experience the subset of system performance issues of the types set forth in Schedule __ from time to time.
8.12.2=Fee Reductions are not, however, intended to be the sole method through which a Data Rights Owner can seek compensation for any breach or default by Data User under this Agreement, and such other remedies can also be pursued, provided that any Fee Reduction applied to benefit a Data Rights Owner under this Agreement shall reduce the amount of any damages or other payments subsequently received from Data User to compensate Data Rights Owner for the same incident that led to a Material Default.&nbsp; Fee Reductions are not intended to be liquidated damages, penalties or similar charges.
8.12.3=Fee Reductions will not be imposed in the event the ESL System performance issue is attributable primarily to: (i) an act or omission of Data Rights Owner; (ii) a Force Majeure event; or (iii) changes in technology equipment or architectures that are implemented by Data Rights Owner without the prior approval of Data User.

8.3.Title=Commissions for Vault Data Sharing Services
8.3.1.1=Nature of Services:&nbsp; As provided in section 3, Data Users may not share Vault Data with any third party without Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; That permission may be granted by Data Rights Owners: (i) on a per-sharing-event basis, (ii) by reference to categories of data, (iii) by identification of limited sets of permitted Observer Users, or (iv) any other method agreed upon by the Data User and the Data Rights Owner from time to time under this Agreement that reflects, carries forward and helps make viable Data Rights Owner co-management of Vault Data under this Agreement.
8.3.1.2=Data Users may only share Vault Data in a manner that reflects and carries into effect the rights of Data Rights Owner, {acting in a capacity as a data version of a "data agent&rdquo; pursuant to the Agency Terms set forth under section 3.___} with respect to any such third party use.&nbsp; In all sharing activities involving Vault Data, and in recognition of Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s primacy in determining the use and disposition of Vault Data, the Data User will act in a way that is consistent with the interests of Data Rights Owner under this Agreement and is in the best interests of the Data Rights Owner when engaging in any Vault Data Sharing Services.
8.3.1={8.3.1.1}<br>{8.3.1.2}
8.3.2=Fees: &nbsp;Data User{, acting in capacity as agent for Data Rights Owner pursuant to the Agency Terms set forth under section 3.____,} shall generate and earn a "Shared Vault Data Commission&rdquo; from providing Vault Data Sharing Services.&nbsp; The commission shall be calculated in the manner provided in Schedule 8.3 (b).

8.4.Title=Payments for Circulating Data Leverage
8.4.1.0.1=A Registered Party acting in its capacity as a Data User may share, transfer, license, exploit, monetize and otherwise use Circulating Data (collectively "Circulating Data Actions&rdquo;) freely and without any Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s permission or consent.&nbsp; Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Rights Owners acknowledges and agree that, because Circulating Data is de-identified data, (i) no direct interests of Data Rights Owner in Vault Data are <em>per se </em>negatively affected solely by such Circulating Data Actions, including but not limited to interests in the nature of those protected by misappropriation and other similar equitable "unjust enrichment&rdquo; concepts, and (ii) there is no risk of direct identity intrusion harm solely as a result of the making available of or sharing with third parties of such Circulating Data.
8.4.1.0.2=Notwithstanding the acknowledgement in the prior sentence, Registered Parties also recognize that the Data Rights Owner is a source of Circulating Data (alone or in combination with other Data Rights Owners from which Vault Data is made available to Data User).
8.4.1.0.3=Thus, while the Data User may use and transfer Circulating Data in its discretion, it must also account to and compensate the Data Rights Owner for a portion of the value realized by Data User attributable to the Vault Data of each Data Rights Owner from which the Circulating Data was derived.&nbsp; This payment is roughly analogous to that made by an oil refining company to a drilling company (or the owner of a well, etc.) for unrefined crude oil, except that payment obligation of a Data User arises, not upon the creation of such Circulating Data, but upon its subsequent use for monetary value.&nbsp; The Vault Data that is made available by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners is the "feedstock&rdquo; of the data leverage (multiple users) in the Circulating Data markets. &nbsp;This Agreement is intended to provide a mechanism for Registered Parties to more explicitly experience the benefits and burdens associated with Circulating Data markets, and to participate, through the choices they make in interacting with other Registered Parties as Data Users, in their co-management and design, development and deployment.
8.4.1.0.4=The parties also recognize that de-identified data can be brought together with other data, or can be applied in contexts (or by Registered Parties with subjective prior knowledge) where it can become "personal information&rdquo; (and therefore once-again classify as "Vault Data&rdquo; under this Agreement) that can "inform&rdquo; one or more parties about a Registered Party or other party, as a result of which such data becomes "re-identified data&rdquo; (and therefore "Vault Data&rdquo;).&nbsp; If and to the extent that any such re-identification event results in the creation of Vault Data, any Registered Party that comes into contact with such Vault Data, whether or not be intention or design, shall have the rights and obligations of a Data User with respect to such Vault Data, which results in the Data Rights Owner automatically receiving "Vault Data&rdquo; Service levels of duty of care, automatically upon such re-identification event, without the requirement of further action by Data Rights Owner, all as dealt with elsewhere in this Agreement.

8.9.2=Any overcharges, undercharges, or errors in computation discovered by a Data Rights Owner and reported to the Data User that are verified by the Data User shall be reflected as compensating adjustments on the next statement issued by Data User following the date of the completion of such verification.
8.9.3=Where Data Rights Owner discovers any net overcharges in excess of five percent (5%) of the amount that should have been payable by Data Rights Owner hereunder, Data User shall, upon request (i) reimburse Data Rights Owner for all costs associated with such review of the accounting; (ii) refund or credit Data Rights Owner (at Data Rights Owner&#39;s option) the full amount of such overcharges; and, (iii) pay Data Rights Owner interest on the amount payable under (i) and (ii) at a rate equal to two (2) percentage points above the &quot;prime rate&quot; as published from time to time by The Wall Street Journal.
